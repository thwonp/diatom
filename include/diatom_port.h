/* Diatom port interface - ADR-0007.
 *
 * THIS HEADER MUST NOT INCLUDE libretro.h, AND NEITHER MAY ANY PORT.
 * That is the mechanical test for whether the seam holds: a port that needs a
 * core to build cannot be developed on the desktop, which destroys the
 * iteration loop the desktop backend exists to provide.
 *
 * The port deals in pixels, samples, buttons and time. Nothing else. If a
 * function name here grows a domain noun - game, save, core, menu - it is in
 * the wrong layer.
 *
 * Port selection is compile-time: one binary per device, no plugin mechanism.
 * Nobody swaps a device backend at runtime on a handheld.

 * game and exited. ADR-0008 made the process long-lived and ADR-0016 handed
 * the display to the launcher per game, and the seam was never grown to
 * match - so `EXIT` and `PAUSED` were sent while this port was still panning,
 * and for a few milliseconds two processes drove the same framebuffer.

 * across several frames: a tear, not a composite.

 *
 *   KEEP  - the last frame. Right for a pause, where the launcher draws its
 *           menu over the frame the player stopped on and wants continuity.
 *   BLANK - opaque black. Right for an exit, where the launcher's first act
 *           is to fade the shelf up from black, so black is the state it is
 *           about to assume anyway.
 *
 * Getting that backwards is visible. Parking KEEP at exit replaces whatever
 * was on screen - the launcher's own menu, if the player quit from it - with
 * a bare game frame for the few tens of milliseconds before the fade starts,
 * which reads as a flash. It is not a tear: it is the wrong picture, shown
