/* Resampling.
 *
 * Cores emit whatever rate their hardware ran at; the device runs at whatever
 * it runs at. Measured from the pinned set - docs/reference/core-facts.md, which
 * is generated rather than transcribed: 32040 (SNES), 44100 (Sega, PC Engine),
 * 48000 (NES), 65536 (GBA) and 131072 Hz (Game Boy). The last is 2.73x the
 * device rate, so this resamples in both directions and never by a tidy ratio.
 *
 * A POLYPHASE WINDOWED-SINC FIR, 32 taps over 512 phases. It replaced linear
 * interpolation, which was a placeholder that measurement caught: on Contra,
 * 18% of 50 ms windows left the resampler with MORE energy above 10 kHz than
 * they arrived with. A lowpass cannot add high frequencies, so that energy was
 * imaging - linear interpolation attenuates the spectral images a rate change
 * creates by only ~13 dB near Nyquist, and they fold back into the audible
 * band. A 32-tap Blackman-windowed sinc puts them below -70 dB.
 *
 * Rate control rides on top: the ratio is nudged +-0.5% to keep the port's
 * buffer near half full. That is not optional here - no console runs at 60Hz
 * (measured: 50.0070 PAL, 59.7275, 59.8200, 60.0000), so a fixed ratio drifts
 * against the panel forever and eventually underruns or overflows.
