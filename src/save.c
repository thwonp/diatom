 * Host-side entirely. The port deals in pixels, samples, buttons and time, and

 *
 * Two different things live here and they are not variants of each other:
 *
 *   SRAM is the cartridge battery - the GAME's own save. Automatic and not
 *   optional, because losing it is a defect rather than a missing feature.
 *
 *   A save state is a whole-emulator snapshot the game knows nothing about. A
 *   frontend convenience, so it is opt-in and takes an explicit path.
 *
 * Everything here writes through write_atomic. Measured on the Brick's card:
 * an 8 KB write costs about 8 ms and a 528 KB write about 68 ms, against a
 * 16.6 ms frame budget of which present already takes 8.4 ms. So a save write
 * can NEVER happen on the frame thread; that is what the writer thread is for.

/* ============================================================================
 * DELETE THIS THE DAY LIBRETRO SYNCS ITS mGBA FORK.
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Two builds that write interchangeable states. This is the ONLY thing in
 * Diatom that knows a particular core by name and version, and it is here
 * against its own scope on purpose and temporarily.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. libretro's mGBA segfaults on every MBC2 Game Boy cartridge -
 * a regression in mgba a1b2b23, reported as mgba-emu/mgba#3859 and fixed
 * upstream the same day in 543a1975. That fix is in no downloadable core:
 * libretro builds from its own fork, unsynced since 2026-08-06. TortOS
 * therefore ships a bridge build - libretro's tree at the pinned commit plus
 * upstream's own one-hunk fix - and it reports `0.11.0` rather than
 * `0.11-219-e31759b` only because there is no git in the build container.
 *
 * WHY IT IS SAFE, which is a claim about these two binaries and not a general
 * one. They are the same commit. The patch touches GBMBCSwitchSramBank, which
 * is mapper code; mGBA's state stores sramCurrentBank as an integer and
 * re-derives the pointer on load, so the fix makes loading MORE correct rather
 * than incompatible. Nothing about the serialized layout differs.
 *
 * WHAT IT BUYS. Without it, swapping between the two rejects every save state
 * - gracefully, the game just starts normally - so the day the official core
 * becomes usable again, every player silently loses their resume points.
 * Battery saves are unaffected either way; .srm is raw cartridge RAM with no
 * version in it.
 *
 * WHEN TO REMOVE IT: as soon as github.com/libretro/mgba carries 543a1975 and
 * TortOS goes back to the fetched core. Then this table is not merely dead, it
 * is WRONG - it would let a genuinely foreign state through. Delete the table,
 * delete version_twins, and restore the plain strcmp above. See TortOS's
 * MGBA-MBC2.md and mk/build-mgba-bridge.sh, which are deleted at the same
