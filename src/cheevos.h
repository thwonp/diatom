/* Achievements: turning what the core offers into the flat address space
 * RetroAchievements writes its conditions against.
 *
 * This lives in Diatom rather than in the launcher because libretro says so:
 * RETRO_ENVIRONMENT_SET_SUPPORT_ACHIEVEMENTS is addressed to the FRONTEND, and
 * the core's only obligation is to expose its address space. The measured
 * reason is in ADR-0025 - conditions compare against the previous frame, and
 * the launcher only sees the socket every 100ms against a 60Hz core, so six
 * frames in seven would be invisible to it.
 *
 * Diatom evaluates. The launcher does the network: it logs in, identifies the
 * game and hands over a condition set. Nothing here opens a socket.
 *
 * Three things have to line up before a condition can be read:
 *
 *   the console      RetroAchievements defines a separate address space per
 *                    console, so `0x06f3` means nothing until you know it is
 *                    an NES. Diatom never guesses this; the launcher knows it
 *                    and says so.
 *   the core's map   SET_MEMORY_MAPS, if the core sends one.
 *   the fallback     retro_get_memory_data, for the cores that do not.
