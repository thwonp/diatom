/* THE PIXEL FORMAT IS THE ONE THING A CORE DOES NOT RE-DECLARE.

 * process: ADR-0006 keeps every core dlopen'd and never unloads it, so the
 * second game on a core skips straight to load_game. Everything else a core
 * says about itself it says again every load, which is why
 * diatom_cheevos_reset can simply throw the old answer away. The format is the
 * exception, and it is the one piece of that state which is process-global.
 *
 * So the format belongs to whichever core initialized LAST, and a core that
 * already spent its retro_init cannot take it back. Read off the device log
 * 2026-09-10, in play order:
 *
 *   retro_init mgba              declares RGB565, GBA correct
 *   retro_init mednafen_pce_fast declares RGB565, PC Engine correct
 *   retro_init fceumm            declares XRGB8888  <- everything flips here
 *   present 240x160 pitch 512    GBA now read 4 bytes to the pixel
 *
 * A 240 pixel row in a 512 byte buffer became a 128 pixel stride, so each row
 * pulled in the next one: every GBA and PC Engine game drew twice across the
 * screen in scrambled color, and stayed that way. genesis_plus_gx was
 * unaffected only because it initialized after the flip.
 *
 * Reported 2026-08-31 and unreproducible for ten days because it needs a
 * specific order - play a core, play a core that disagrees, go back to the
 * first. Nothing about it is rare once you know to do that. */
