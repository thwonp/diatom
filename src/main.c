 * it held, or - a direct binding (ADR-0039) - on its own button alone
 * (plorpos-gkd.22 retired the fixed SELECT+L1/R1/A display chord into the
 * display/filter actions). The modifier layer wins while the modifier is held.
 * The very first frame of a modifier chord still reaches the core, which reads
 * input inside retro_run before this runs - harmless, not worth a pre-run
 * poll. A direct binding's button is hidden on every frame instead, so it
 * never leaks.
 *
 * Display and filter are edge-triggered like save/load: display steps to
 * the next mode and wraps, filter flips sharp/nearest.
 * (ADR-0037's Home is one of the choices on the GKD, as "home".)

 * FF and rewind are level-triggered - the bound button's own hold state
 * drives g_ff_speed/g_rewind_active for as long as it is held, mirroring
 * NextUI's HOLD_FF/HOLD_REWIND rather than the TOGGLE_* variants, which
 * would need persistent on/off state this does not track. Save/load state
 * are edge-triggered, firing once per press against sn->state_exit - the
