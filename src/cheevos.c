/* Achievements: the address space, and reading from it.
 *
 * See cheevos.h for why this is Diatom's job and not the launcher's, and
 * ADR-0025 for the measurement behind it.
 *
 * A RetroAchievements condition names an address like `0x06f3`. That address
 * is not the core's, and it is not the console's either: it is an offset into
 * a flat space RetroAchievements defines per console, whose layout lives in
 * the vendored rc_consoles.h. The job here is to lay the memory a core has
 * actually offered underneath that space, in order, leaving holes where
 * nothing maps - because an RA address is an offset into the CONCATENATION of
 * the spans, so quietly dropping an unmapped region would shift every address
 * after it and make conditions read the wrong bytes rather than fail.
 *
 * Two sources, in order of preference:
 *
 *   SET_MEMORY_MAPS      a core describing its whole address space, region by
 *                        region. Richer, and the only way to reach anything
 *                        beyond system RAM.
 *   retro_get_memory_data(RETRO_MEMORY_SYSTEM_RAM / SAVE_RAM / VIDEO_RAM)
 *                        always available if the core supports achievements at
 *                        all. save.c already uses the SAVE_RAM sibling of this
 *                        call, so the binding exists.
 *
 * Both are captured rather than trusted to persist. libretro's header is
 * explicit that a memory map belongs to the core for the duration of the call
 * only - "the frontend must maintain its own copy of this object and its
 * contents" - and a core re-declares its map on every retro_load_game, so a
 * pointer held across a load points into memory that core has freed.
 *
 * PROVENANCE. The descriptor decoding and the region-splitting below follow
 * rcheevos' own src/rc_libretro.c, which is MIT like the rest of it and like
 * Diatom. ADR-0025 records why that one file is not vendored - it drags in
 * rhash's disc and archive readers for playlist hashing Diatom will never do -
 * but not vendoring it is not a license to guess. The console tables it reads
 * ARE vendored and are used here unmodified; what is rewritten is the plumbing
 * between them and libretro's descriptors, and it is rewritten to match. The
 * bit-collapsing loop in desc_for() is upstream's, which took it in turn from
 * RetroArch's mmap_reduce.

 * a hole rather than a short read - they are still claimed by the descriptor,
 * so they have to be spanned or every later address shifts.
 *
 * MBC2 is the case that makes the gap concrete rather than theoretical: the
 * Game Boy's cartridge RAM window is 8KB and mGBA allocates 256 bytes for it,
 * because the mapper keeps 512 nibbles internally instead of driving a RAM
 * chip. That is a window thirty-two times its allocation, in a shipped core.
 *
 * BE CLEAR THAT THIS FIXED NOTHING WE HAVE SEEN. The MBC2 crash chased on
 * 2026-09-09 was inside mGBA, on its own sramBank, and no clamp here would
 * have stopped it.
 *
 * Whether an MBC2 cart even reaches this function turns on something
 * unrelated to the mapper: whether RetroAchievements knows the title. X
 * resolves as Unknown and takes the retro_get_memory_data path; Kirby's
 * Pinball Land resolves as GameBoy and maps twelve spans through here. So
 * this code IS exercised by an MBC2 cart. What is NOT established is the
 * clamp ever firing, which needs a span measured shorter than its descriptor
 * claims, and no build carrying this code has run on the device yet.
 *
 * The three blocks retro_get_memory_data answers for are the only memory
 * whose true size can be asked for, so a pointer inside one of them is
 * clamped to the end of it. A pointer belonging to none is left alone rather
 * than rejected: cores describe memory through their map that they expose by
 * no other route, and refusing to read it would break every core whose map is
