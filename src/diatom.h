/* Diatom internals.
 *
 * One module organized by file, not by layer. An earlier proposal split "core
 * host" (ABI conformance) from "session" (lifecycle, policy) as separate
 * layers; that seam had one implementation and almost nothing a core asks via
 * RETRO_ENVIRONMENT_* can be answered from ABI knowledge alone. See register §2.
 *
 * The boundary that does matter here is temporal, not architectural:
 * per-game versus per-frame. Everything policy-ish resolves once at load into
 * diatom_policy, which the frame loop reads as plain fields. Cores are
 * permitted to call GET_VARIABLE every frame; a naive implementation would do
 * string comparisons at 60Hz.
