/* A libretro core that is not an emulator.
 *
 * Exists so Diatom can be developed and tested with no third-party binary
 * present. It implements the API and draws a test pattern, which is enough to
 * exercise every path the frontend has: dlopen and symbol binding, the
 * environment callback, the copy-then-present video path, integer scaling,
 * resampling, input, and pacing.
 *
 * It deliberately reproduces the awkward cases the env-inventory spike measured
 * in real cores, because those are exactly what a happy-path stub would hide:
 *
 *   - 59.7275 fps, not 60      : no console runs at 60, so pacing must not assume it
 *   - 32040 Hz sample rate     : forces the resampler to actually resample
 *   - SET_GEOMETRY mid-run     : 3 of 6 measured cores change geometry while running
 *   - RGB565                   : what all six chose when offered a choice
 *
 * It can also be told to die, which is the only way to test the crash side of
 * the protocol - `EXIT reason=crash` versus `ERROR code=crash`. That belongs
 * here rather than in Diatom: a frontend with a --crash flag would be test code
 * living in the shipped binary, and the whole point is that Diatom learns about
 * the crash the same way it will in the field, from a signal it did not raise.
 *
 *   STUBCORE_CRASH=segv[@N]   null dereference, at frame N (default 60)
 *   STUBCORE_CRASH=stack[@N]  unbounded recursion - needs the altstack
 *   STUBCORE_CRASH=abort[@N]  abort(), so SIGABRT
 *   STUBCORE_CRASH=fpe[@N]    integer divide by zero - a NO-OP on ARM, which
 *                             does not trap it; kept because it does trap on
 *                             x86 and the difference is worth being able to see
 *   STUBCORE_CRASH=exit[@N]   exit(1), which raises no signal at all
 *   STUBCORE_CRASH=load       die inside retro_load_game, before RUNNING
 *
 * STUBCORE_SAVEDIR_PROBE=1 makes retro_load_game write an empty
 * stubcore.probe into the dir GET_SAVE_DIRECTORY names, so a test can see
 * which save dir a game was given without the stub having a battery.
 *
 * STUBCORE_SRAM=1 gives it a battery: 64 bytes of SAVE_RAM that, like a real
 * core's, outlive the game, and whose first byte goes up by one at frame 30 of
 * every game - a save, as far as the frontend can tell.
 *
 * It also exposes a small, entirely predictable block of system RAM, so the
 * achievement path has bytes to watch without an emulator. See sysram below.
 *
 * Test fixture. Not part of Diatom's runtime.
