/* The port's audio contract, exercised against a real port.
 *
 * ADR-0007 says the port owns opening a device and the host owns choosing one,
 * and ADR-0029 leans on three properties that nothing here used to check:
 *
 *   it falls back    a device that will not open leaves the port on the
 *                    default and STILL RUNNING, because a sink that can be set
 *                    while a game runs can fail while a game runs
 *   it is idempotent re-stating the current device does not tear down a
 *                    working stream and lose what is queued
 *   it returns       switching NEVER blocks the caller
 *
 * The last one is why this file exists. Closing an SDL audio device joins its
 * audio thread, and that thread can be stuck writing to a sink that stopped
 * draining - so the close never returns and the frame loop stops forever. That
 * shipped on 2026-09-04 and wedged the device on the 5th, with the emulation
 * still running behind a frozen picture. A hang is not a failure any assert
 * can catch, so this arms an alarm and lets the timeout be the failure.
 *
 * Runs against port/desktop.c with the dummy audio driver: no device, no
 * sound, no network. The Brick's port is the same code shape and cannot be
 * driven from here.
 *
 * Also the arithmetic under both ports' clock, which is shared and so can be
 * checked from here for the Brick too: port_clock.h, and why it exists.
