"""Does the state plane answer on the wire?

ADR-0020 defines a state as three things - a query verb, a write verb, and the
query verb repeated unsolicited when Diatom changes it. Every part of that is a
promise to a launcher in another repository, and none of it is visible to a
compiler: a verb can be added to the enum, parsed, dispatched, and still never
reach a socket because one branch returns early.

So this speaks the protocol. It starts Diatom with no core and no ROM - the
resident, idle state a launcher connects to first - and asks.

Audio output (ADR-0029) is what it covers today, because that state's whole
point is a device that can FAIL, and the failure has to arrive as an answer
rather than as an error or a silence. The others predate this file; add them
here when one of them next needs changing.

Fast and offline: no core, no ROM, no frames, about a second. It skips rather
than builds when there is no binary, so `make check` keeps costing nothing.
