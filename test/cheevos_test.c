/* Does a RetroAchievements address reach the byte it is supposed to?

 * ADR-0025 moved achievements into Diatom on the strength of one claim: that
 * conditions compare against the PREVIOUS FRAME, so only something running at
 * frame rate can evaluate them. This is that claim, executed. It runs a real
 * condition out of Blaster Master's set through the vendored runtime, against
 * memory laid out by src/cheevos.c, and checks that it fires on the frame it
 * should and not on the frame before.
 *
 * It is offline and takes no core and no ROM: the "console" here is two byte
 * arrays. That is the point - the mapping is a pure function of what a core
 * declares, so it can be tested without one, and a test that needs hardware is
 * a test that stops being run.
