"""ADR-0020's state plane, end to end against the stub core.

Every case here is one that was actually got wrong while building it, which is
why they are cases rather than a smoke test:

  - the map read as "everything unbound" before any game had run, because
    identity had not been saved yet. Only the IDLE path shows it.
  - a refused SETMAP left the table cleared rather than unchanged.
  - labels have to follow a remap, or a remap screen shows the wrong verbs.

Since extended past ADR-0020's four states to whatever else the plane carries -
session persistence (ADR-0024) and achievements (ADR-0026) - because the
harness and the fixture are the same and a second copy of both would drift.

The level half cannot be tested here: a desktop has no volume or brightness of
its own, so `LEVELS count=0` is the whole of it. Levels are exercised on
hardware by `protodrive --state`.
