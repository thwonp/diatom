"""Headless conformance: does Diatom still do the same thing, in the same space?

Three properties, and each exists because §11 - the section this project calls
its own thesis - asserted nothing at all:

  determinism   the same core, ROM and frame count produce the same final
                frame. Without this the other checks cannot be trusted, since a
                run that varies has nothing stable to compare.
  sensitivity   N and N+1 frames must DIFFER. The control: a determinism check
                passes perfectly on a frontend that renders one frozen frame,
                so something has to prove the test can fail.
  space         peak RSS stays under a ceiling, and - where the toolchain can
                wrap malloc - Diatom's own allocation count is identical at N
                and 2N frames, which is what "no malloc in the frame loop"
                actually means.

The allocation check needs `-Wl,--wrap`, a GNU ld feature. Apple's ld64 has no
equivalent, so on macOS it reports as skipped rather than passing silently. The
device half, which is the one the memory thesis is about, is
`tools/conform-device.sh`.
