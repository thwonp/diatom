/* TrimUI Brick (TG3040) port.
 *
 * Presentation is raw fbdev with a flip thread; SDL2 (the firmware's own
 * library, via the sysroot - ADR-0012) provides audio, joystick input and the
 * monotonic clock.
 *
 * fbdev is not a fallback, it is the device's native display path. Measured
 * 2026-08-24 on firmware 1.1.1: scanout is the Allwinner disp2 engine
 * (/dev/fb0 -> the "disp" platform driver), while /dev/dri/card0 is only the
 * PowerVR render node (pvrsrvkm) with no display capability. The firmware's
 * SDL2 has exactly one real video driver, "mali", whose EGL swap blocks
 * ~30ms - two vblank intervals - regardless of swap interval, which quantized
 * the frame loop to 30fps.
 *
 * FBIOPAN_DISPLAY is itself a blocking vsync'd flip. Measured: a pan issued
 * right after vblank returns in one interval (a tight pan loop sustains
 * 60fps), but one issued mid-interval misses the latch deadline and waits for
 * the vsync after next (~25ms). A self-paced loop always lands mid-interval,
 * so calling pan inline halved the frame rate exactly as the EGL swap did.
 *
 * Hence the flip thread. present() only blits and publishes the page in a
 * latest-wins mailbox, never blocking, which is the seam's contract; the
 * thread pans at the panel's own rate and eats the blocking wait. Flips latch
 * at vblank, so no tearing; three pages mean the page being drawn is never
 * the one on glass or in flight. The frame loop keeps its own absolute clock,
 * exactly as on desktop - no console runs at the panel's rate.
 *
 * The firmware keeps its SDL2 outside the default linker path, so run with:
 *
 *   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/trimui/lib ./diatom --core X.so --rom game
 *
 * This file does not include libretro.h and must never need to.

 * binary. So: a raw ioctl on a device node, which is what this port already
 * does for /dev/fb0. The struct layout is vendored from the kernel UAPI rather
 * than depended on, and its SIZE is baked into the request number by _IOWR -
 * validated against the running kernel by tools/mixprobe.c before it was
 * written here (sizeof 1224, read agreed with tinymix to the digit).
 *
 * `digital volume` is 0-63 and **INVERTED**: 0 is loudest, 63 is silence. The
 * driver advertises `dBscale-min=-74.24dB, step=+1.16dB`, i.e. that higher is
 * louder. That metadata is wrong. Proven by diffing the mixer across a
 * volume-up press in the device UI: 37 -> 15 when turned UP.
 *
 * `Headphone Volume` is 0-7 at 6 dB a step and is **INVERTED** too: 0 is
 * loudest, 7 is near silence, and its TLV lies about the direction exactly the
 * way `digital volume`'s does. Nothing on this codec's metadata can be trusted.
 *
 * This comment used to say the opposite - that the control was not a speaker
 * level, and that raising it rerouted output to the headphone JACK and muted
 * the speakers. That was wrong, and it was wrong in the most expensive way
 * available: `HpSpeaker Switch` drives the speaker off the headphone stage, so
 * this control gates everything the device plays. Whoever wrote the note
 * raised it, heard the speaker fall away, and reached for routing to explain
 * an attenuation. Settled by ear on 2026-08-31 with no plug in the jack - at 7
 * the speaker is barely audible, at 0 it is loud. It had sat at 3 since the
 * project began, so every sound Diatom has ever made was 18 dB down.

/* The part of that range you can actually hear.
 *
 * The register goes to 63 and stops being useful long before it: measured on
 * the speaker against a room baseline of 33 rms, raw 26 is 173 rms - five times
 * the room, quiet but unmistakably there - and by raw 34 it is 55, which is 1.6
 * times the room and indistinguishable from nothing. Spreading twenty levels
 * across the whole 63 therefore spends more than half the slider below the
 * floor: level 10 of 20 landed on raw 31, about two and a half times the room,
 * which is what "50% and very quiet" is.
 *
 * TortOS's launcher already had this number - the sweep was done there and the
 * constant is GAIN_RAW_USABLE in its src/platform.c. The port carries its own
 * copy of the mapping because it owns the level while a game runs, and only one
 * of the two was corrected. Same measurement, same ceiling, so the bar means
 * the same thing on the shelf and in a game.
 *
 * Those rms figures were taken with HP_CTL already at 0 - the sweep script sets
 * it before measuring - so they describe the chain as it behaves now, and the
 * 18 dB mixer_defaults() restored was never inside them. A note here briefly
 * claimed otherwise; it was inferred instead of read off the script that made
 * the table. The gap was between the SWEEP and gameplay, not inside the sweep,
 * which is why the table looked sane while the device sounded quiet.
 *
 * The weakness is the instrument. Those readings came from a microphone across
 * the room, where raw 26 is 5.2x the room and raw 34 is indistinguishable from
 * it - but a handheld sits at arm's length, and what reads as silence over
 * there is plainly audible in your hands. The floor is therefore set by ear,
 * not by this table.
 *
 * That session had ONE WORKING SPEAKER, unknown at the time. The quiet channel
 * turned out on 2026-09-02 to be a loose connection on the PCB; resoldered, and
 * both now play evenly. So 39 was originally judged against roughly half this
 * device's output - and it stood anyway, re-heard on the repaired hardware the
 * same day across the quiet end, the balance and the general sound. Two
 * independent confirmations now, not one lucky derivation.
 *
 * 39, chosen on the device on 2026-08-31 with a game playing, stepping the
 * register down until Eric called it: raw 37 is barely audible and is where he
 * wanted position 1. 39 is the constant that lands position 1 on 37 in both
 * this ladder and the launcher's, which round differently; 26 put it on 25.
 * Position 20 still lands on raw 0, so maximum is unchanged.
 *
 * The cost is resolution: about 2.3 dB a press rather than 1.5, in exchange for
 * 45 dB of range rather than 30. Worth it - 30 dB down is not quiet in a quiet
 * room, which is the thing a microphone across the room could not tell us. */
#define GAIN_RAW_USABLE 39

/* The jack wants a different window, not the same one moved.
 *
 * Set by ear on 2026-09-02 with a game playing and a plug in, the same method
 * that produced 39. The ceiling first: above raw 8 it is uncomfortable, so 8 is
 * where level 20 belongs. Then the floor, stepping down - 37, 45, 49, 53 and 57
 * were each still too loud to be a minimum, and 61 was called right.
 *
 * So the jack spends 53 register steps where the speaker spends 39, which an
 * offset cannot express: offsetting from the ceiling would put level 1 on 47,
 * and 45 was rejected on the way past. Headphones are far more efficient than
 * this speaker, so the same twenty steps have to cover more ground - 61 dB
 * against 45, about 3.1 dB a step rather than 2.3.
 *
 * The launcher carries the same four numbers in its src/platform.c, for the
 * same reason it carries GAIN_RAW_USABLE: this port owns the level while a game
 * runs and the shelf owns it otherwise, so a level that crosses the socket has
 * to mean the same thing on both sides. Change one, change the other. */
