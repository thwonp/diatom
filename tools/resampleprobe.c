/* What does the resampler actually do to a signal it cannot argue with?
 *
 * Game audio is a bad test bench. `hfprobe` measured "energy above 10 kHz" on
 * Contra and scored LINEAR INTERPOLATION as the better filter - because linear
 * interpolation has 2.5 dB of droop up there, and losing treble looks identical
 * to not adding artifacts when all you have is one band ratio. A resampler has
 * to be judged on a signal whose spectrum is known exactly.
 *
 * So: push a pure tone through the real `src/audio.c` at a chosen rate ratio,
 * write what comes out, and let `tools/hfprobe.py --spurs` find everything that
 * is not the tone. Anything else IS the filter, because the input had one
 * component and nothing else.
 *
 *   resampleprobe <src_rate> <dst_rate> <tone_hz> <seconds> <out.raw>
 *
 * Links src/audio.c directly and stubs the two port calls it makes, so it
 * measures the shipping code rather than a copy of it that can drift.
 *
 * An instrument. See tools/README.md.
