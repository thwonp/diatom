/* Does Diatom allocate inside its frame loop?
 *
 * §11 is the project's stated thesis and its "no malloc in the frame loop" item
 * said **Unverified. Believed true.** This is what turns that into a number.
 *
 * Linked with `-Wl,--wrap=malloc` and friends, which rewrites those calls in
 * the objects being LINKED. A core arrives by `dlopen` and binds its own malloc
 * through libc, so it is invisible here - and that is exactly right, because
 * the claim under test is that *Diatom* does not allocate per frame, not that
 * no code anywhere does. Cores allocate; several of them must.
 *
 * The measurement is DIFFERENTIAL, not absolute. Run N frames and 2N frames:
 * start-up allocations are identical in both, so anything the frame loop does
 * shows up as the difference. That is what lets this exist entirely outside
 * Diatom - no counter to arm, no hook to call, nothing test-shaped in the
 * shipped binary. The same reason the crash fixture lives in stubcore rather
 * than behind a `--crash` flag.
 *
 * An instrument. See tools/README.md.
