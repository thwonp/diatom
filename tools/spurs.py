"""How much of the output is not the tone that went in?

`resampleprobe` pushes a single sine through the real resampler. The input has
exactly one spectral component, so everything else in the output was made by the
filter. That makes the number unarguable in a way a game recording is not - see
the header of tools/resampleprobe.c for how measuring Contra reached the wrong
conclusion twice.

    python3 tools/spurs.py <out.raw> <dst_rate> <tone_hz>

SFDR is the loudest spur relative to the tone, in dB below it. Bigger is better.
Linear interpolation should look poor here; a windowed sinc should not.

An instrument. See tools/README.md.
