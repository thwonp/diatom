/* Can a port read and set the backlight with no vendor headers?
 *
 * TortOS's libmsettings shows brightness going through /dev/disp rather than a
 * sysfs backlight class - this device has no /sys/class/backlight at all. The
 * Allwinner disp2 driver takes plain command numbers with an unsigned long[4]
 * argument block, not _IOWR-encoded requests, so there is no struct size to get
 * wrong; the risk is the command numbers themselves.
 *
 * Same reason mixprobe exists: find out against the running kernel before any
 * of it reaches port/brick.c.
 *
 *   dispprobe          read brightness
 *   dispprobe <n>      set it, read back, and report
 *   dispprobe --sweep  write a ladder of low values, read each back, restore
 *
 * The sweep exists for a narrower question than the other two: port/brick.c
 * floors brightness at 8/255, and 8 was CHOSEN, not measured. If the driver
 * clamps low values itself then the floor is a hardware fact and belongs in
 * the port; if it stores whatever it is given, the floor is a judgment about
 * what a person can still see and needs eyes rather than an ioctl. Find out
 * which before spending anyone's attention on it.
 *
 * An instrument. See tools/README.md.
