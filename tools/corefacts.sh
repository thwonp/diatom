# Why this exists
# ---------------
# On 2026-08-25 an audit found that four of the six rows in ADR-0015's aspect
# table described cores the project had since rejected. PicoDrive reports
# Genesis at aspect 1.3333; Genesis Plus GX, which replaced it, reports 1.5238.
# Snes9x 1.63 reports 1.3333 and max 604x478; snes9x2010, which replaced it,
# reports 1.5842 for PAL and max 1024x478. Nothing could detect that, because
# the table was keyed on the SYSTEM. A system does not report an aspect - a
# specific core build does, and the number had been separated from the binary
# that produced it.
#
# CORES.md already said the intent out loud: "this file exists so the
# measurements in docs/ name the exact bytes that produced them." Saying it was
# not enough. This measures it.
#
# The same audit then made the same mistake: three of the five cores it measured
# on the device were not the pinned binaries at all, because the device staging
# directory had drifted from CORES.md. So the first thing here is not the
# measurement, it is verifying the bytes - both on the host and on the device
# after the push. A measurement of the wrong binary is worse than no
# measurement, because it looks like evidence.
