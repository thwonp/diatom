# Verifies the cores Diatom's measurements were made against, fetching any that
# are missing, from libretro's own buildbot.
#
#   tools/fetch-cores.sh                 the whole test matrix
#   tools/fetch-cores.sh gambatte mgba   just these
#
# Why this exists, and why it records rather than vendors:
#
# Cores are THIRD-PARTY binaries that Diatom does not ship, build or depend on
# (see docs/working-agreement.md). Diatom has no core list. But the test matrix
# is evidence - the geometry, envelope and pacing claims in docs/ rest on
# specific binaries - and evidence whose provenance is unstated cannot be
# re-checked. So the bytes stay out of the repository and the manifest goes in,
# the same trade ADR-0012 made for the sysroot.
#
# The buildbot publishes to latest/, which is UNPINNED. That is the exact drift
# ADR-0012 rejected `:latest` for, and it cannot be fixed from this end: the
# buildbot keeps no archive to pin to. What can be fixed is knowing what was
# actually used, which is what CORES.md is for. A core's own reported version
# string, logged whenever Diatom runs it, usually carries an upstream git hash
# and is the stronger record of the two.
#
# THIS SCRIPT VERIFIES. IT DOES NOT DISCOVER.
#
# Until 2026-09-05 it did the opposite: it truncated CORES.md, fetched whatever
# the buildbot was serving, and wrote the hash it had just computed. Nothing
# compared that against the hash already in the file, so a republished core
# silently replaced the pin and the run printed `ok` - in a file whose own text,
# which this script generates, says "these hashes are the pin". Three ways to
# lose a pin without being told, all from the same design:
#
#   - a republished core overwrote its hash;
#   - a partial run (`tools/fetch-cores.sh mgba`) rewrote the manifest with one
#     row, dropping the other four;
#   - a failed fetch `continue`d past the manifest write, dropping that row, and
#     the run still exited 0.
#
# TortOS's mk/fetch-vendor.sh met the same event correctly, because its hashes
# are literals in the script and a mismatch stops it. That is the shape adopted
# here. The pin is the table below; CORES.md is generated FROM that table rather
# than from whatever came down the wire, so the two cannot drift and no run can
# narrow the file.

# The buildbot republishes on any upstream commit, weekly translation syncs
# included, and by 2026-10-03 had replaced every pinned core. The pinned bytes,
# unmodified, are mirrored on a TortOS release (aarch64 only) and fetched from
# there. mgba is the exception: no copy of the pinned buildbot build survived,
# so it still comes from BASE and fails its pin until re-pinned (plorpos-gkd.79).
MIRROR="https://github.com/thwonp/TortOS/releases/download/cores-2026-08"
# Licenses are pinned below with the hashes, and re-checked on every run against
# libretro's own core-info repo, which is where the `license` field a frontend
# would display is maintained. Pinned rather than simply recorded: the question
# "which of these are GPL" sat open in the register for days, and an answer that
# a network blip can turn into "UNKNOWN" is not an answer.

# THE PIN, and the date it was established. Nothing here changes on its own.

# The five cores cover all nine in-scope systems and actually run on the device.
# snes9x2010 rather than mainline snes9x: mainline is C++ and wants
# GLIBCXX_3.4.29 (see below), while 2010 is pure C, holds frame rate, and is the
# only light fork that reports the correct 50.0070 PAL rate - 2002 and 2005 say
# 50.3197, which runs PAL content 0.62% fast. picodrive for the Sega block
# since 2026-10-07, replacing genesis_plus_gx: it alone has 32X, and the
# geometry that lost it the 2026-08-25 comparison was its load-time report -
# see that spike's second postscript and ADR-0046. No gambatte:
# mGBA covers GB and GBC identically, from a smaller binary, and gambatte is C++
# so it cannot run here anyway.
#
# To adopt a republished core: decide to, rather than letting a fetch decide for
# you. Then change the line here AND in TortOS's mk/fetch-vendor.sh together,
# and re-measure every row in docs/reference/core-facts.md that used it, because
# each of those numbers was made against the old bytes.
#
# Fields: name, sha256, bytes, license. License is last so it may contain
# spaces.
