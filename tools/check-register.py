"""Structural checks on docs/scoping-register.md.

The register is the project's resume point: read a section, see what is left.
By 2026-08-25 it could no longer do that. It had grown 418 -> 992 lines in
three days and never once shrunk, because every resolution was APPENDED rather
than substituted:

  - Section 10 opened with five unticked questions and then, twelve lines down,
    a `RESOLVED -> ADR-0006` block ticking the same five.
  - The core-options work created `## 4c. Core options` and left
    `## 12. Core options and config` standing with its stale boxes.
  - Saves did the same thing: `## 5b` records ADR-0016 while `## 9` still asks
    about SRAM write policy and slot convention.

None of that was neglect - the register was edited in 15 of the 16 ADR commits.
It was a habit: writing the resolution is the satisfying part, and deleting the
question it answers feels like discarding information in a project whose whole
discipline is to keep the reasoning. The reasoning lives in the ADR. The
register only needs to say what is left.

So this exists for the same reason `check-seam` does. That rule held because a
build fails when it is broken, not because anyone remembered it. Nothing ever
failed when the register drifted, so it drifted.

Two severities, and the split is deliberate:

  FAIL     structural facts a machine can be certain about. Ordering, a
           resolved section still carrying open questions, an undeclared tag.
  WARN     suspected fossils - an open item that looks answered by a ticked one
           elsewhere. Needs a human to decide, so it never fails a build. A
           check that cries wolf is one people learn to ignore, which is worse
           than no check at all.

  tools/check-register.py            check the working tree
  tools/check-register.py --diff     also enforce substitution over appending
