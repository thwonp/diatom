# **busybox here has no pkill at all.** It exited 127, the exit status was not
# checked, and "no such command" looked exactly like "nothing to kill". Use
# `ps | grep | xargs kill`, and check STATE rather than trusting any kill.

# Output gain, opt-in via DIATOM_GAIN. TortOS resets the mixer when its UI
# resumes, so setting this from the host before the freeze is always pointless -
# it has to happen here, inside it.
#
# Measured 2026-08-25: the chain is four controls and only one of them was
# actually attenuating. `digital volume` sat at 37 of 63, which is -31.3 dB,
# while `DAC volume` and `Headphone` both read as set. Reading one control at a
# time hides that; the whole chain has to be set together or not at all.
# DIATOM_GAIN drives `digital volume`, and that control is **INVERTED**:
# it is an ATTENUATION register, so a LOWER number is LOUDER.
#
#   0  = loudest      15 = a normal listening level      63 = silent
#
# Proven by diffing tinymix across a volume-up press in TortOS on 2026-08-25:
# the value went 37 -> 15 when the user turned it UP. The driver's own metadata
# claims `dBscale-min=-74.24dB, step=+1.16dB`, i.e. that higher is louder. That
# metadata is wrong, and trusting it cost two hours: every "louder" setting made
# it quieter, and 63 - set as "maximum" - is silence.
#
# `Headphone Volume` stays 0 and is not a speaker level: raising it routes to
# the headphone JACK and mutes the speakers. TortOS zeroes it deliberately.
