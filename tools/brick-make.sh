# wrote, so make concludes a target is current when its source is not. The

# the test exercises the previous binary. Both times it read as a bug in the
# feature under test - once as SAVE silently doing nothing, once as a fix that
# appeared not to work.

# So: after building, refuse to be quiet about an output older than ITS OWN
# source. Comparing against the newest source anywhere flags every target
# whenever one file changes, which is noise - and a check people learn to ignore
# is worse than no check.
