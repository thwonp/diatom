# Minimal libretro frontend - scoping register

A living checklist. Its one job is that you can read a section and see what is
left, so **the checkbox is authoritative** - `- [x]` means settled, and the line
says what settled it. Prose below a checkbox explains; it never overrules.

**How to keep it that way.** A resolution **replaces** the question it answers;
it is never appended below it. The reasoning belongs in the ADR, the spike or
the discussion log - the register only owes the fact and the pointer. New work
goes in the section that already owns the subject rather than a new lettered one
beside it, and section numbers never change, because ADRs are immutable and
several of them cite these numbers.

**Say what settled it.** A ticked item should point at the ADR, spike or log
that settled it - or say plainly that it is a **judgment call** made here and
now. Both are legitimate; conflating them is not. On 2026-08-25 a sweep that was
clearing fossils - items *evidence* had already settled - also closed a genuinely
open question by argument, in the same batch and the same `- [x]`. It inherited
the credibility of everything around it. "Decided while tidying" is a fine thing
to record and a bad thing to disguise.

**A settled item gets six lines.** Enough for the question, the answer, the one
number that matters and a link; not enough to restate an ADR. This one is not
about tidiness: fossils were only half the growth, and 79 settled items left to
run long is a third of the file describing work that is *finished*, with the
open items drowning in it. If an answer needs more room, the room is an ADR, a
spike or a log - and if none of those exists yet, writing one is the work.

That is not advice. `make check` fails on section order, on a resolved section
still carrying open items, on two sections covering one subject, on a tag not
declared below, on a settled item over six lines, and on an Accepted ADR that
nothing points at or that is missing from the decisions index. It got written
because none of those ever failed before, and by 2026-08-25 the register had
grown 418 to 992 lines in three days without once getting shorter - carrying,
among other things, five questions ADR-0006 had answered two days earlier.

Tags: **[LB]** load-bearing (expensive to reverse - decide early) ·
**[OPEN]** needs a decision · **[LATER]** safe to defer ·
**[DEFERRED]** was load-bearing, deliberately postponed with a written reason
and a trigger for revisiting - distinct from `[LATER]`, which was never urgent ·
**[NOT PLANNED]** off the path entirely for now, and not because it was
rejected - the work it depends on comes first. Different from `[LATER]` in that
nothing is waiting for a decision, and from `[DEFERRED]` in that no trigger is
being watched. Items tagged this way still carry their reasoning, because "we
chose not to" is worth more later than silence.

**On `[LB]` discipline.** Load-bearing means *expensive to reverse* - a
published interface, a data format, something with multiple implementations
depending on it. It does **not** mean "important" or "interesting". Internal
organization you could refactor in an afternoon is not load-bearing, however
much discussion it generates. Several items were over-tagged on 2026-08-23 and
downgraded; a register where everything is load-bearing guides nothing.

Three questions for whether a question is even ready to answer:
1. **What kind of claim is it?** Spec-derivable → read the spec. Runtime
   behavior → measure. Taste → just decide.
2. **What does being wrong cost?** Cheap to reverse → decide fast and move on.
3. **Is anything blocked on it?** If not, deferring is a legitimate answer, and
   this register exists so deferral doesn't mean forgetting.

---

## 0. Guiding tension

"Abstracted to perfection" = **seams in the right places with nothing leaking
across them**. It does *not* mean maximum layers. On a 1GB device at 60fps,
indirection has a measurable cost. The test for every proposed boundary:

> Does this seam let me swap one real implementation for another real one?

If there will only ever be one implementation behind an interface, it isn't an
abstraction, it's a tax. Two known implementations (desktop + device) is the
bar that justifies a seam.

---

## 0b. Target class, not target devices *(proposed 2026-08-23)*

The frontend should be designed against a **stated device class**, with the
Brick and Miniloong as instances that validate it - not as its definition.
Deriving the envelope from today's two devices bakes them into something meant
to outlive them. Same discipline as §0: one instance is not a class.

Draft class: low-power ARM Linux handheld · ≤1GB RAM · no swap · 4:3-ish panel
that admits integer scaling · SDL2 available · d-pad + face/shoulder buttons,
analog optional.

Chain: **device class → what's possible (ceiling) · taste → what's chosen per
firmware (subset) · chosen set → test matrix + memory envelope.** Devices
constrain; they do not determine. TortOS runs three systems by curation, not
because the Brick is incapable of more.

- [x] **[LB]** Class definition **ratified by use, 2026-08-25.**
      [ADR-0003](decisions/0003-digital-only-input.md) and
      [ADR-0005](decisions/0005-system-inclusion-criteria.md) both reason
      from it and were Accepted; a premise two accepted decisions rest on
      is ratified whatever the checkbox said. Amend by superseding those.
- [x] **[LB]** **Must Diatom survive PS1/Neo-Geo-class workloads? No.**
      → [ADR-0005](decisions/0005-system-inclusion-criteria.md). Peak loaded game
      ~10-30 MB estimated, against 956 MB. This is what makes
      [ADR-0006](decisions/0006-keep-all-cores-resident.md) possible.

Known instances (measured 2026-08-22/23):

| | Brick (TG3040) | Miniloong Pocket 1 |
|---|---|---|
| SoC | Cortex-A53 (`CPU part 0xd03`, measured) | Rockchip RK3566, Cortex-A55 ×4 |
| RAM | **975 MB** (998,332 kB, measured) | 956 MB (978,824 kB, measured) |
| Swap | **0** (measured) | 0 |
| Kernel | 4.9.191 | 5.10 |
| Panel | 1024×768 | 720×960 portrait → 960×720 landscape |
| Controls | (unverified - no analog?) | d-pad, A/B/X/Y, L1/R1, L2/R2, Select, Start, Mode, L3, analog |
| Rotation | not needed | **required** |

Both devices measured 2026-08-22/23. **Zero swap on both** - the fact underneath
the file-backed-versus-anonymous reasoning in ADR-0006 and ADR-0010, now
verified rather than assumed.

## 1. Identity and project shape

- [x] **[LB]** Name: **Diatom** →
      **[ADR-0004](decisions/0004-name-the-project-diatom.md)** *(Accepted)*
- [x] **[OPEN]** Collisions checked 2026-08-23 - none in the CFW / libretro
      frontend / handheld firmware space. One accepted out-of-domain hit:
      `diatom-lang/diatom`.
- [x] **[OPEN]** Symbol prefix: **`diatom_`** (2026-08-23). Recorded in
      `working-agreement.md` as a convention, not an ADR - pervasive but cheap to reverse.
      Explicit over terse, and `dia_` is a substring of `media_`.
- [x] **[OPEN]** Port naming → **the device is the name.** `desktop` and
      `brick`, chosen by use rather than by decision. The `flint`/`slate`/`chalk`
      proposal was made when the project was itself a stone and stopped being
      automatic when it became a diatom; a port named after the hardware also
      needs no key.
- [x] **[LB]** License → **MIT**, 2026-08-25. 0BSD was the presumption for two
      days and was never acted on; the repository had no LICENSE at all. The
      deciding difference is **attribution**, which is 0BSD's only practical
      cost: the code is ~2,400 lines but the artifact is the ADRs, the spikes
      and this register, and a copyright line is the thread back to them.
- [x] **[OPEN]** Licensing position on `dlopen`-ing GPL cores from an MIT
      frontend → **[ADR-0023](decisions/0023-core-licensing.md)** *(Proposed)*.
      MIT is GPL-compatible, so even the strictest reading yields no conflict,
      and Diatom ships no cores. **GPL was the easy half**: two of five pinned
      cores are *non-commercial*, covering four of nine systems, which the
      question never contemplated. Licenses now recorded by `fetch-cores.sh`.
- [x] **[LB]** Fork relicensed → **PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0**, 2026-09-28 →
      **[ADR-0036](decisions/0036-relicense-polyform-noncommercial.md)** *(Superseded by 0042)*.
      Voided ADR-0023's "MIT is GPL-compatible" premise while it stood.
- [x] **[LB]** License per file → **MIT by default, PolyForm Noncommercial only
      for NextUI-derived code**, 2026-10-03 →
      **[ADR-0042](decisions/0042-license-per-file-mit-default.md)** *(Accepted)*.
      Supersedes 0036 in full, for every version of the fork. NC: `rewind.*`,
      `hotkeys.*`, three fenced regions of `main.c`; `NOTICE` lists them.
      Restores 0023's premise for the MIT parts.
- [x] **[LB]** Standalone repository → **[ADR-0002](decisions/0002-separate-repository.md)** *(Accepted)*
- [x] **[LB]** Decision-recording practice: ADRs → **[ADR-0001](decisions/0001-record-architecture-decisions.md)** *(Accepted)*
- [x] **[OPEN]** **A real launcher drives Diatom in production.** TortOS
      migrated 2026-08-26 (its `DIATOM-MIGRATION.md`, five phases, all
      verified on hardware): Diatom is its resident emulator, its one-shot
      fallback, and its only emulator - minarch is deleted. First contact
      found the zip gap in under a minute and the launch-animation display
      hazard, exactly the class of thing the stand-in could not.
- [ ] **[DEFERRED]** Consumption model - submodule, subtree, vendored copy, or
      prebuilt artifact. **Deliberately deferred 2026-08-23: nothing consumes
      Diatom yet.** Choosing an integration model before either side exists means
      choosing without the information that makes it obvious. Decide when TortOS
      actually needs to embed it, by which point how often the two change
      together will be known.

      Notes for when it is revisited:
      - **Submodule** - pin is structural, but detached HEAD, `--recursive` on
        clone, and a two-step pointer bump that is silently easy to forget.
        Worst precisely during co-development, which is the phase this will be
        in for months.
      - **Subtree** - same files-in-tree result as vendoring, but git records the
        provenance instead of a README claiming it. `--squash` keeps the log
        clean. Better for co-development: edit in place, `subtree push` upstream.
      - **Manual vendoring** - what `minarch/overrides/` does today, and the
        reason TortOS's docs claim a `v6.11.2` baseline while the build actually
        reads `v6.11.2-10-g96eeacd9`. The provenance lives in prose and drifts.
      - Weaker argument than it first appeared: the NextUI drift was a *third
        party* moving underneath. Diatom is Eric's - it only changes when he
        changes it.
- [x] **[OPEN]** Design work migrated into the `diatom` repository 2026-08-23
      under `docs/`. The scoping folder is gone.

---

## 1b. Implementation language *(settled 2026-08-24)*

**C, and it stays C.** Never previously decided - it was inherited rather than
chosen - so it is written down now.

The deciding number: of 2,410 lines outside `libretro.h`, only 342 (`scale.c`,
`audio.c`) are pure logic. The other 2,068 are the C ABI, `dlopen`'d function
pointers, raw frame buffers, `mmap`, `ioctl` and pixel loops. **In Rust that is
86% `unsafe`** - a memory-safe language whose guarantee stops exactly where the
risk lives. Diatom is almost entirely boundary, because that is what a frontend
is.

- **C++** is worse than neutral here: Diatom `dlopen`s C++ cores, and bringing
  its own libstdc++ risks two C++ runtimes in one process. `RTLD_LOCAL`
  (ADR-0010) isolates symbols, not exception tables or static init order.
- **Go** fails on FFI shape, not weight. libretro is callback-driven: a core
  polls `input_state` per button per frame, and each is a C-to-Go transition
  with a scheduler hop, plus a GC that can land inside a 16.6 ms budget already
  carrying 8.4 ms of blit.
- **Rust** is viable and buys little, per the 86% above.
- **Zig** would be the interesting choice if starting today - it targets a
  chosen glibc version natively, which is half of ADR-0012 for free - but it is
  pre-1.0 and breaks between releases, which contradicts pinning the toolchain
  by digest.

Weight is not the constraint on this device class and that assumption was wrong:
Diatom is 51 KB against a 12.6 MB Genesis Plus GX core and 975 MB of RAM. A Go
binary would be one core's worth.

**Revisit if** Diatom grows a large *safe* surface - a real UI, netplay, save
sync, scripting - which inverts the ratio, or if a target is Android, where
bionic and JNI change everything.

## 2. The layer model - "what goes where"

### Vocabulary *(settled 2026-08-23)*

"Frontend" was doing two jobs and caused real confusion. Use:

- **launcher** - the UI the user sees (TortOS's shelf). Belongs to the firmware.
- **host** - loads and runs a libretro core. **This project.**
- **port** - the per-device platform backend.
- **core** - the emulator plugin. libretro's word; never reused for our code.

### Structure

```
firmware: TortOS / EROS / future
├── launcher UI ....................... firmware's own, not ours
└── HOST  ← this project
      ├── core loading + env callbacks + run loop   (one module)
      └── port ..... video · audio · input · clock · paths
            ↓
      backend:  desktop │ brick │ miniloong
```

**Only one seam here is load-bearing: host ↔ port.** It has three real
implementations, and getting it wrong means rewriting all of them.

The **host ↔ core** boundary is not ours to design - libretro specifies it. Our
job there is conformance, not architecture.

### Design intent - internal host organization *(not a decision; revisit with code)*

An earlier proposal split "core host" (ABI conformance) from "session" (game
lifecycle, timing, policy) as separate layers. **Current intent: don't.** They
should be one module organized by *file*, not by *layer*.

Reasoning, which is spec-derivable rather than empirical: almost nothing a core
asks via `RETRO_ENVIRONMENT_*` can be answered from ABI knowledge alone.
`GET_SAVE_DIRECTORY`, `SET_PIXEL_FORMAT`, `SET_ROTATION`, `GET_VARIABLE`,
`SET_HW_RENDER`, `GET_INPUT_DEVICE_CAPABILITIES` all need port or session state
- and they arrive from inside `retro_run`, crossing the boundary every frame in
both directions. An interface that must be handed both neighbors' state to
function is a pass-through, not a separation.

**The boundary worth drawing instead is temporal, not architectural:**
*per-game* versus *per-frame*. Resolve all policy - paths, controller type,
pixel format, options, geometry - once at game load into a flat struct the
frame loop reads as plain fields. No allocation, no string lookup, no policy
branching in the hot loop. Cores are permitted to call `GET_VARIABLE` every
frame; a naive implementation will do string comparisons at 60Hz.

*Not an ADR:* it fails the bar in `decisions/README.md` - internal organization,
no external contract, changeable in an afternoon. Verify cheaply by reading
`libretro.h`'s environment enum rather than taking the argument on trust.

*Would be wrong if:* the policy struct needs per-frame mutation. Even then the
answer is a live policy object, not a layer.

- [x] **[OPEN]** Confirmed against `libretro.h` 2026-08-23 by running six
      cores through a full lifecycle →
      [env inventory](spikes/2026-08-23-env-inventory.md). 34 of 77
      commands appear, ~17 need real answers, and they do arrive from
      inside `retro_run` needing port and session state, as argued.
- [x] **[LB]** Dependencies point strictly downward →
      [ADR-0007](decisions/0007-port-interface.md). The port never calls up, and
      `make check-seam` enforces the mechanical half of it: a port that included
      `libretro.h` could not be developed on the desktop at all.
- [x] **[LB]** **The host owns the main loop.**
      [ADR-0008](decisions/0008-separate-long-lived-process.md) and
      [ADR-0009](decisions/0009-launcher-protocol.md). The launcher drives it
      over the socket but does not run it, which is what lets a game outlive a
      launcher that died - and `HANGUP` is deliberately not a stop.
- [x] **[LB]** **Standalone operation as the primary mode.** Built that way. Diatom runs
      with no host at all:

      ```
      diatom --core snes9x_libretro.so --rom parodius.sfc
      ```

      That is how the desktop backend runs, how it is tested, and how a
      prospective consumer evaluates it without adopting a firmware. The
      launcher protocol ([ADR-0009](decisions/0009-launcher-protocol.md)) then
      becomes an **embedding mode** for hosts wanting a resident process -
      an additional interface, not the fundamental one.

      Does not supersede ADR-0008 or ADR-0009; both stand. Designing for a
      program that stands alone is a stricter test than designing for one
      embedder, and it is what keeps Diatom from being a component of somebody
      else's launcher.
- [x] **[OPEN]** Port selection **compile-time, not runtime** - one binary per
      device, port linked in. Stated in
      [ADR-0007](decisions/0007-port-interface.md) and in `diatom_port.h`:
      nobody swaps a device backend at runtime, so a plugin mechanism would be
      an abstraction with no consumer.

---

## 3. Process boundary

When this section was written the launcher ran `minarch.elf` as a child over a
fifo, and its docs cited the GPL firewall as the reason. It does not any more:
it migrated to Diatom over a socket on 2026-08-26. The section stays because
the reasoning below is what settled the boundary, and that reasoning survived
the migration. If the frontend becomes 0BSD the GPL reason evaporates, but two
others remain:

- Crash isolation: a bad core takes down the child, not the launcher.
- Memory reclaim: on 1GB, process exit is the only *guaranteed* way to get
  everything back from a leaky core.

- [x] **[LB]** Separate, **long-lived** process →
      **[ADR-0008](decisions/0008-separate-long-lived-process.md)** *(Accepted)*.
      The GPL reason is gone; what carries it now is that a core segfault must
      not take the launcher down, because the boot hook powers the device off
      when the launch loop exits.
- [x] **[LB]** Protocol → **[ADR-0009](decisions/0009-launcher-protocol.md)**
      *(Accepted)*. One Unix domain socket, line-based tab-separated
      `key=value`. Collapses five mechanisms (two fifos, pid file, temp file,
      signal) into one. `ERROR` = never started; `EXIT` = ran and stopped -
      a rule about **display ownership**, not error reporting.
- [x] **[OPEN]** **Achievements cross the boundary as a path, not as data** →
      **[ADR-0026](decisions/0026-achievements-on-the-launcher-protocol.md)**
      *(Proposed)*. The launcher declares the console on `RUN` and names a file;
      Diatom reports `CHEEVO id= state=` as things fire.

      The path is not tidiness. Measured across 428 achievements from four
      RetroAchievements sets on 2026-08-29, the median condition string is 113
      characters and **the longest is 30,897** - Gran Turismo 2. The protocol line
      buffer is 4096 bytes and drops the rest with a warning, so a third of
      those sets contain an achievement that would never have been watched, and
      an unwatched achievement looks exactly like an unearned one.

      The console id has to be declared because nobody on this side can infer
      it: an RA address is an offset into a per-console space, libretro has no
      call that asks, and `genesis_plus_gx` is three consoles anyway.
- [x] **[LB]** **What happens to a second connection?** →
      **[ADR-0033](decisions/0033-the-newest-connection-wins.md)**
      *(Accepted)*. It displaces the first: a daemon held a dead launcher's
      socket and the next one blocked in `connect` at boot. Built 2026-09-18;
      on the Brick a second client was greeted mid-connection and the launcher
      reconnected on its next launch. check-proto covers it.
- [x] **[OPEN]** **The launcher can say something during a game** →
      **[ADR-0027](decisions/0027-an-overlay-the-port-composites.md)**
      *(Proposed)*. It renders pixels, `OVERLAY path= ms=` carries them, and
      the port composites them the way it already composites the level bar.

      The problem was not drawing, it was ownership: one presenter at a time
      (the handoff spike), so the launcher physically cannot put anything on
      screen while Diatom holds the display. An achievement fired and nobody
      could mention it.

      The port function is named `diatom_port_overlay` and takes pixels and a
      duration, because §4's rule is that a domain noun in this header means
      the wrong layer - `notice` or `achievement` would have broken it.
- [x] **[OPEN]** The power-off failsafe is respected: the launcher stays alive
      as supervisor, and `SIGUSR1` is retained as the escape hatch for a core
      wedged inside `retro_run` that cannot read the socket.
- [x] **[OPEN]** Remaining risk carried by ADR-0008: **display handoff between
      two processes.** The invariant is *one presenter at a time*, not one
      process per display. Concurrent presentation deadlocked the pan in-kernel
      ([ADR-0013](decisions/0013-brick-fbdev-flip-thread.md)). Re-check per port.
      [handoff spike](spikes/2026-08-24-display-handoff.md).

## 4. Port interface (the most important seam)

Candidate surface - deliberately small:

- **Video**: init(geometry), present(frame, w, h, pitch, format), geometry
  change, teardown
- **Audio**: open(sample_rate), queue(samples, count), queued_frames(), close
- **Input**: poll(), state(port, device, id)
- **System**: monotonic clock, sleep, paths, log
- **Optional/device**: brightness, LED, CPU governor

- [x] **[LB]** Is that the complete surface? Answered by
      [ADR-0007](decisions/0007-port-interface.md), and worth recording that the
      answer moved: it specified **ten** functions and implementation made it
      **twelve within a day** - `should_quit` and `capture`. Both look justified
      and neither carries a domain noun, but a surface that grows 20% on first
      contact is worth noticing rather than shrugging at.
### Proposed division of labor *(2026-08-23, not ratified)*

| Concern | Host (shared) | Port (device) |
|---|---|---|
| Scaling | compute factor + offsets from core geometry vs surface | perform the blit / present |
| Rotation | **nothing - never knows** | everything |
| Pixel format | force one format on cores | convert only if the panel demands otherwise |
| Input | map canonical buttons → retropad | produce canonical buttons |
| Audio | resample to the rate the port reports | report native rate, accept PCM |
| Timing | pace against core fps | monotonic clock, present |

The scaling split is the point: **deciding the factor is arithmetic** (shared,
so every port behaves identically), **performing the blit is hardware**. Put
both in the port and the math gets duplicated per device and drifts.

Rotation is the test of whether the seam holds. The Miniloong's framebuffer is
720×960 portrait; if anything above the port learns that, the abstraction has
leaked.

**Anti-pattern:** the port interface will want to grow. If a port function's
name contains a domain noun - game, save, core, menu - it is in the wrong
layer. The port deals in pixels, samples, buttons, time, paths. Nothing else.
Every concept admitted to the port interface must be reimplemented per backend,
including desktop - which is how the desktop backend rots and stops being
usable for iteration.

- [x] **[LB]** Ratified and superseded in detail by
      **[ADR-0007](decisions/0007-port-interface.md)** *(Accepted)* - ten
      functions; the port must never include `libretro.h`.

Two amendments ADR-0007 makes to the table above:

- **Pixel format passes through** (accept RGB565 + XRGB8888, refuse 0RGB1555)
  rather than the host forcing one on cores. Both convert free on SDL texture
  upload, so forcing would sometimes *add* a conversion.
- **Paths leave the port entirely.** `save` and `system` are domain nouns. The
  launcher supplies paths to the host at startup.

- [x] **[OPEN]** Does the port ever get to refuse a geometry? No - the host
      computes `dst` and the port blits. Scale policy never reaches the port.
- [x] **[OPEN]** Does the port ever get to *refuse*? **No.** `diatom_port.h`:
      a `dst` may extend past the surface because a fill or overscale mode
      deliberately crops, and **ports clip; they never refuse the frame.**
      Whether a geometry is worth showing is host policy.
- [x] **[OPEN]** Backends to build: `desktop` (SDL2, first) and `brick`
      (TG3040). **Miniloong is [NOT PLANNED]** as of 2026-08-25 - not rejected;
      Diatom complete on the Brick comes first. Consequence worth naming: the
      rotation abstraction stays **unproven** until a portrait panel exists, and
      every Miniloong number here describes a device nothing builds for.
- [ ] **[LB]** SDL2 as the baseline for both desktop and device, or something
      lower on device? Tracked with its measurements in §5 - video already left
      in ADR-0013, so on the Brick SDL2 now does only audio, joystick, clock and
      capture.

---

## 5. Video

- [x] **[OPEN]** Force a single pixel format, or support all three? **Support
      two, refuse one.** RGB565 and XRGB8888 pass through; 0RGB1555 is refused
      ([ADR-0007](decisions/0007-port-interface.md)). Forcing would sometimes
      *add* a conversion, since both accepted formats upload free. All six cores
      measured chose RGB565 when offered the choice, so the XRGB8888 path is
      accepted-but-untested and says so in `diatom_port.h`.
- [x] **[LB]** Does the destination rect move when a core changes geometry
      mid-run? **No** - [ADR-0011](decisions/0011-lock-the-display-rect.md)
      *(Accepted)*. Computed once from base geometry at load and held. Measured:
      3 of 6 cores call `SET_GEOMETRY` mid-run, and recomputing an integer
      factor from the new width collapses 3x to 1x. Its own limit is recorded
      below - base geometry is not representative for the Sega cores.
- [x] **[LB]** Integer-scale-only as a hard rule? **No** -
      [ADR-0014](decisions/0014-display-modes-and-default.md). It is one of six
      modes and no longer the default. Kept as `--display integer` for anyone who
      wants uniform pixels, and it remains the sharpest option by construction.
- [x] **[OPEN]** What happens when integer scaling doesn't fit - answered by
      [ADR-0014](decisions/0014-display-modes-and-default.md): the question
      dissolves, because integer is now one choice among six rather than the
      rule. `integer` still letterboxes at the largest factor that fits.
- [x] **[LB]** **A launcher can set the display mode per game** →
      **[ADR-0022](decisions/0022-display-mode-on-the-state-plane.md)**
      *(Accepted)*. `RUN` carried no mode, so it was process-wide; ADR-0018 and
      ADR-0021 both show the best mode differs by system (16 points of panel
      between `integer` and `aspect` on Genesis). Second contested row on
      ADR-0020's plane, of the three its threshold allows.
- [x] **[LB]** **Which display mode is default** →
      **[ADR-0014](decisions/0014-display-modes-and-default.md)** *(Accepted)*.
      `stretch`, judged on the panel: a handheld's screen is its whole
      interface, and full use of it beat both the letterbox and the crop. Seven
      modes ship; integer stays for anyone who wants uniform pixels.
- [x] **[OPEN]** A seventh mode, `integer-vertical` →
      **[ADR-0018](decisions/0018-integer-vertical-remeasured.md)** *(Accepted)*,
      superseding ADR-0015. Shape-exact to 0.03% everywhere, but **not "never
      worse"** as 0015 claimed: it loses a whole vertical factor on SNES PAL and
      Genesis. Live numbers: [core-facts.md](reference/core-facts.md).
- [x] **[LB]** **Cut the mode set to three** →
      **[ADR-0040](decisions/0040-three-display-modes.md)** *(Accepted)*,
      superseding ADR-0014's set and ADR-0018. `integer`, `aspect`, `stretch`;
      default still `stretch`. Per-console tables: `fill` is `aspect` or a
      crop, `overscale` crops both axes, `native` is 1-11% of the panel,
      `integer-vertical` is `aspect` or smaller. User's call, 2026-10-02.
- [x] **[LB]** **Shaders on the GKD: who owns the list** →
      **[ADR-0041](decisions/0041-shader-chains-are-sent-not-named.md)** *(Accepted)*.
      The launcher sends the chain itself (`SETDISPLAY shader=` passes,
      `final=`); diatom compiles and draws it, all or nothing, and says it
      back in `DISPLAY`. No list file, flag or query on this side. GKD only;
      desktop and Brick take None. User's call, 2026-10-02.
- [x] **[LB]** **Shaders on the Brick: how it presents them** →
      **[ADR-0043](decisions/0043-brick-draws-through-egl-while-a-shader-is-set.md)** *(Accepted)*.
      fbdev for None as before; an EGL window only while a chain is set,
      switched at the next present, never two presenters. Same fifteen chains
      as the GKD, all measured at full speed on real cores. User's call, 2026-10-05.
- [x] **[OPEN]** Aspect-ratio and overscan policy → **the user chooses**, from
      seven modes defaulting to `stretch`
      ([ADR-0014](decisions/0014-display-modes-and-default.md),
      [ADR-0015](decisions/0015-integer-vertical-mode.md)). FCEUmm reports an
      **8:7 pixel aspect (1.2190), not 4:3**, so no single mode is "correct".
- [x] **[OPEN]** Whether sharp-bilinear is worth its cost. **Shipped, not
      default** ([ADR-0014](decisions/0014-display-modes-and-default.md)). Free
      at whole factors once trivial weights collapse; +2ms on the fullscreen
      modes; +7.3ms on `aspect`, the only geometry with two fractional axes and
      the only combination that has ever dropped a frame. Nothing visible was
      gained at these factors, so `nearest` is the default.
- [ ] **[DEFERRED]** **Remove the display chords and the per-combination timing
      table** from `src/main.c`. Both were built for the mode comparison and
      both are still the instruments for the last open display question (Game
      Boy at +20% and `integer-vertical`, on the panel). **Trigger: that look is
      done.** Then either delete them, or justify runtime mode changes on their
      own merits once ADR-0009's protocol exists - ADR-0014 leaves hotkey
      ownership open. Recorded so they cannot persist by inertia; the on-screen
      overlay from the same session was already removed (commit `b7f1258`).
- [x] **[OPEN]** Rotation → **the port hides it entirely.** `surface_w/h` are
      logical and always landscape; a core asking `SET_ROTATION` is declined
      because honoring it would rotate twice. **Designed, not proven** - the
      only portrait panel is the Miniloong, so by §0's own test this abstraction
      does not yet have two implementations behind it.
- [ ] **[LATER]** Zero-copy: `GET_CURRENT_SOFTWARE_FRAMEBUFFER` - **confirmed
      2026-08-23: FCEUmm requests it every frame.** The path ADR-0007 deferred
      is actively offered. Still deferred; good to know it is real.
- [x] **[OPEN]** Pixel format - **all six cores chose RGB565** (measured). The
      XRGB8888 path ADR-0007 accepts is currently dead code; do not build or
      test it until something needs it.
- [x] **[OPEN]** Geometry changes mid-run are **common, not exotic** - 3/6 cores
      call `SET_GEOMETRY` during `run`. Snes9x `max 604×478` vs `base 256×224`;
      Beetle PCE `max 512×243`. Confirms recompute-on-change.
- [ ] **[NOT PLANNED]** **PC Engine breaks integer scale on one device but not
      the other.** 256x**243** at 3x is 768x**729** - over the Miniloong's 720
      lines, inside the Brick's 768, so the same content gets 2x on one and 3x
      on the other. Parked with the Miniloong port (§4): it cannot bite a device
      nothing builds for. Real again the moment that port is.
- [ ] **[LATER]** **Drop SDL2 from the Brick port?** Video already left in
      ADR-0013; SDL2 now only does audio, joystick, clock and BMP capture there.
      **Measured 2026-08-24: SDL2 costs 223 ms at startup** - `SDL_Init` 86.7 ms
      (udev enumeration) plus `SDL_OpenAudioDevice` 135.9 ms - about a third of
      a 625-750 ms cold launch.

      **But it is paid per PROCESS, not per ROM**, and both ADR-0008
      (long-lived process) and ADR-0006 (cores stay resident) delete it from the
      per-launch path entirely. In the designed steady state a launch is
      `retro_load_game` plus a 27 ms warmup, and neither the 223 ms nor the
      ~400 ms of `dlopen` is in it. An earlier note here claimed this cost lands
      on the headline value; it does not, except in the spawn-per-game harness
      we currently test with.

      **The launch-time case is therefore weak** and the remaining reasons are
      secondary. If it is ever revisited, the gain is only the *difference* -
      raw ALSA also pays to open the device - so it still needs a spike timing a
      direct ALSA open and an OSS `/dev/dsp` open.

      Secondary benefit if done: DRC currently targets `SDL_GetQueuedAudioSize`,
      which is SDL's own queue rather than the hardware buffer. Reading
      `snd_pcm_avail` would let the control loop measure the thing it actually
      controls, and would explain the queue overshoot logged at 4927 frames
      against a stated 4096 capacity.

      Cost: ~250 lines of device-only code that cannot be tested on the
      development machine, and a desktop port that becomes a weaker behavioral
      proxy for the device.

      **Explicitly NOT a portability argument.** Static linking cannot deliver
      that: `dlopen` in a static binary still requires the shared libraries from
      the glibc it was linked against, which is the coupling it was supposed to
      escape. ADR-0012 already solves portability by building against the oldest
      glibc in scope.
- [x] **[LB] [OPEN]** **ADR-0011 locked the rect from a boot artifact** →
      **[ADR-0021](decisions/0021-settle-the-rect-before-locking.md)**
      *(Accepted)*. genesis_plus_gx's load-time 256x192 lasts 1-29 frames of
      3600, so `integer` scaled Herzog Zwei by 3.20x/3.43x; relocking when the
      locked geometry proves transient gives 3.00x on both axes. PC Engine was
      wrong too, and core-facts.md was generated from the boot mode.

- [ ] **[OPEN]** **Saves do not transfer between cores for the same game.**
      Measured: Herzog Zwei reports 16 KB of SRAM under PicoDrive and **64 KB**
      under Genesis Plus GX, with states of 679 KB and 1036 KB. ADR-0016's
      state header already refuses a foreign state; SRAM falls back to
      `min(file, sram)` with a warning, which is the right default but means
      switching cores silently truncates or pads a save. A launcher that lets a
      user change core per system needs to know this.
- [x] **[LB]** **The blit was the frame's dominant cost; it is not any more.**
      A row cache made it **2.1-2.3x faster** (8.4-8.7 ms to 3.6-4.1 ms),
      byte-identical across eight combinations. **The disp2 hardware scaler is
      not needed** - the blit was never write-bound.
      [blit cost](spikes/2026-08-25-blit-cost.md).
- [x] **[OPEN]** **`diatom_port_capture` was non-deterministic** and had been
      since the flip thread was written: it read the front page without waiting
      for the pending flip, so the captured frame depended on how fast the blit
      was. Fixed. Found while verifying the blit change, which is the argument
      for verifying by comparison rather than by inspection.
- [x] **[OPEN]** **A core swap changed NES geometry** - and three other rows
      with it. 256x240/1.2190 became 256x224/1.3061 on the buildbot FCEUmm;
      Genesis and SNES moved further. Resolved by generating the table instead
      of transcribing it ([core-facts.md](reference/core-facts.md)) and
      re-deciding on the real numbers
      ([ADR-0018](decisions/0018-integer-vertical-remeasured.md)).
- [x] **[OPEN]** GL/GLES or software blit on device? **Software, into raw
      fbdev** ([ADR-0013](decisions/0013-brick-fbdev-flip-thread.md)), and the
      row cache made it 2.1-2.3x faster. The hardware scaler was measured
      *unnecessary* rather than rejected on taste: the blit was never
      write-bound, framebuffer memory and heap both at 418 MB/s.
- [x] **[OPEN]** **GBA drawn twice, left and right halves. FIXED 2026-09-10 in
      b6141b5: the pixel format was wrong, not the pitch.** Reported
      2026-08-31 on Sigma Star Saga while cycling display modes, after a card
      wipe. **Not reproduced for ten days** - every mode renders correctly,
      halves measurably different. Nothing in the scaler explains it, and these were ruled out:

      - map index overflow: `diatom_tap` is `{ int idx; int w; }`, no 8-bit wrap
      - pitch misread: `cache_row` does `src + row*pitch` in BYTES and reads
        `src_w` PIXELS, so the units are right
      - stale maps: `ensure_maps` rebuilds on src, dst and filter
      - panel wrap: the blit clamps x1 to xres and the fb has no horizontal
        virtual space (stride 4096 = 1024 * 4)
      - a cross-thread race: SETDISPLAY is handled by `diatom_proto_poll` AFTER
        present on the same thread, so maps cannot be freed under a blit

      What was actually wrong is that it left no trace: `present:` logged only
      on a dst change while `ensure_maps` also rebuilds on src w/h and filter,
      so a mid-run geometry change rebuilt them silently. Fixed - it fires on
      any of the three and prints pitch and format.

      Measured while doing it: mGBA reports **pitch 512 for a 240-wide frame**,
      a padded buffer, legal and handled. Only a stride SHORTER than the width
      could double a row. Next occurrence will have a log line saying what the
      port was handed.

      **It did, and that is how it was caught.** 2026-09-10, on Advance Guardian
      Heroes:

          present: src 240x160 pitch 512 (128 px) fmt 1 -> dst 1024x768
                                                  <-- STRIDE SHORTER THAN WIDTH

      `fmt 1` is XRGB8888, so the same 512-byte pitch that is 256 pixels at
      RGB565 became **128 pixels at four bytes each**, under a 240-pixel width.
      Every row pulled in the next one. The pitch was right the whole time and
      the ruling-out above was correct: `cache_row`'s units are right, and they
      are right per pixel, of the wrong size.

      The format is process-global and announced from `retro_init`, which runs
      once per core per process (ADR-0006). A core that has already spent it
      cannot take the format back, so whichever core initialized last owns it.
      In play order that day: mgba declared RGB565, PC Engine agreed, then
      fceumm declared XRGB8888 and every GBA and PC Engine frame after it was
      read four bytes to the pixel. genesis_plus_gx was unaffected only because
      it initialized after the flip. That is why it needed a specific order -
      play a core, play a core that disagrees, go back to the first - and why
      ten days of trying the obvious thing never hit it.

      Fixed by recording what each core declares and restoring it on every
      load. Verified on the device in the order that triggers it: Advance
      Guardian Heroes launched after an NES game reads at `fmt 0`, 256 px
      against 240, no warning and no doubling.
- [ ] **[DEFERRED]** **Hardware-rendered cores (GL/Vulkan) - no `SET_HW_RENDER`
      today.** Spiked 2026-10-01 on the GKD (plorpos-gkd.15.1; throwaway clone
      outside the repo, never pushed). Question: can diatom present a Vulkan
      core zero-copy? **No, on this driver**: the Mali-G52 blob returns
      VK_SUCCESS with fd -1 from `vkGetMemoryFdKHR` in all ~8 dma-buf variants,
      so EGL import has nothing to import. Readback works (SwanStation and
      ParaLLEl-RDP drawn correctly through the SDL renderer). N64 wants GL, not
      Vulkan: ParaLLEl-RDP misses 60 fps even at 1x while GlideN64 does 168-196.
      Options and numbers are in bead plorpos-gkd.15.2; PSX ships on
      pcsx_rearmed's software 2x meanwhile. Trigger: N64, or PSX above 2x.
- [ ] **[LATER]** Shaders/overlays - **a one-word decision waiting on taste,
      not on facts.** The facts: UI belongs to the launcher
      ([ADR-0009](decisions/0009-launcher-protocol.md)); the on-screen overlay
      built for the mode comparison was deleted the day it stopped earning its
      place; and the blit work left ~11.3 ms spare per frame on NES, so the
      headroom exists. Nothing needs it and nothing blocks on it.

## 6. Audio - expect this to be the hard part

### Measured 2026-08-23 ([spike](spikes/2026-08-23-env-inventory.md))

| Core | fps | Sample rate |
|---|---|---|
| FCEUmm (PAL) | **50.0070** | 48000 |

| Beetle PCE | 59.8200 | 44100 |
| mGBA | 59.7275 | **65536** |

**Five distinct frame rates, five distinct sample rates.** Only PicoDrive hits
exactly 60. **DRC is mandatory, not a refinement** - there is no configuration
in which rates line up.

Two levers the spike discovered:

- **`GET_TARGET_SAMPLE_RATE`** (cmd 81) - a core asks what rate we want.
  Answering lets it generate at the device rate natively and skip resampling
  for that core entirely.
- **`SET_AUDIO_BUFFER_STATUS_CALLBACK`** (cmd 62, 3/6 cores) - cores offer to
  *receive* buffer occupancy and throttle themselves. The core-side half of DRC.

- [x] **[LB]** Sync strategy → **dynamic rate control**, built. A PI controller
      nudges the resample ratio to hold the port's buffer near half, clamped to
      **0.5%** so the pitch shift stays inaudible, with the integral term
      deliberately slow (~8 s to full authority). Per the table above there was
      never an alternative: no configuration exists in which the rates line up.
- [x] **[OPEN]** `GET_TARGET_SAMPLE_RATE` → **implemented**, and `audio.c` has
      the pass-through it exists for: a core that answers generates at the
      device rate and skips resampling entirely. Central resampling is the
      fallback, not the only path.
- [x] **[OPEN]** Target output rate → **follow the device**. The port reports
      `caps.audio_rate` and the host resamples to it; nothing is fixed at 48k.
- [x] **[OPEN]** Buffer size → **4096 frames capacity, held near 2048** (~85 ms
      at 48 kHz, targeting ~43 ms). Every run reports queue min/max/final
      against both, so a bad choice shows up rather than being argued about.
- [x] **[OPEN]** Frame overrun → audio never blocks and drops on overflow; the
      frame loop drops its debt past four frames behind (§7). A blocking write
      would pace the whole program off the audio clock, which rules out DRC.
- [x] **[LB]** **The resampler is a 32-tap polyphase windowed sinc**, replacing
      linear interpolation. SFDR up a mean of **27.6 dB** over nine rate pairs including
      131072→48000, the 2.73:1 worst case (worst overall 21.7 → 68.0), and the
      passband stops drooping: linear was -3.5 dB at 11 kHz, this is flat.
      Costs +0.16 ms of a 16.6 ms frame, no dependency.
      [measurement](spikes/2026-08-26-resampler.md)
- [ ] **[LB]** **Who sets core-option defaults?** FCEUmm ships
      `fceumm_sndquality = Low`, plus "Reduce Triangle Channel Popping" and
      "Reduce DMC Channel Popping" both **disabled**. Very High plus both cut
      large sample-to-sample jumps by **42%** (138/s to 80/s) on Contra. But
      **Diatom has no core list** (§12) and setting per-core defaults would
      break that. So either the launcher ships them in its config, or the
      principle bends. Nothing is broken today - minarch has the same defaults -
      but "sounds right out of the box" is a real product question.
- [ ] **[OPEN]** **Startup audio transient, bounded but not zero.** After
      discarding warmup audio, NES PAL still drops **1244 frames** and PC Engine
      **575**, constant at 300/900/1800 frames so still purely a transient
      (~26 ms once per launch, down from 86 ms). Priming fills to half of 4096,
      leaving ~2 frames of headroom; a quarter would leave 3 and trade against
      underrun. A tuning question that wants someone listening, not a number.
- [ ] **[OPEN]** **The resident plays silence while no game is loaded.**
      Measured on the Brick 2026-09-13: with nothing loaded, the resident
      Diatom used **4% of a core** - 46 ticks in a 10s window - against the
      launcher's 25% beside it. port/brick.c opens the device with
      `SDL_OpenAudioDevice` and unpauses it on the next line, and nothing pauses
      it again: it is only closed at shutdown or when the sink changes. An open,
      unpaused SDL device fed by `SDL_QueueAudio` keeps SDL's audio thread
      waking every buffer period to pull from an empty queue, so the codec is
      held awake emitting silence for as long as the process lives.

      **Attributed by elimination, not sampled per thread.** The main thread
      sits in `poll(-1)`, and the flip and SRAM writer threads both wait on
      condition variables, which leaves SDL's audio thread as the remaining
      candidate. Worth confirming per thread before acting on.

      **It may be deliberate, and that is the decision.** A device that stays
      open is what makes a launch start sound without a reopen, and the item
      directly above is the startup transient that a cold open produces.
      Pausing while idle and unpausing on load would save the thread and the
      codec, at the risk of bringing back a click or latency on every launch
      rather than once. Measure the transient both ways before choosing.
- [x] **[OPEN]** **Output gain on the Brick, two traps.** `digital volume`
      (0-63) is the speaker level and is **INVERTED** - lower is louder - while
      the driver advertises `step=+1.16dB`, the opposite. `Headphone Volume` is
      not a speaker level: raising it routes to the jack and mutes the speakers,
      which is why TortOS zeroes it. Volume is firmware's job (§8), so Diatom
      sets neither; `DIATOM_GAIN` in `brick-run.sh` is for testing only.

      **The curve measured, 2026-08-28.** `tools/micprobe.sh` playing a 440 Hz
      tone at -1.4 dBFS, captured on the device's own mic, room baseline ~40:

      | `digital volume` | rms | vs room | modeled |
      |---|---|---|---|
      | 0 | 10034 | 201x | 0 dB |
      | 16 | 1485 | 30x | -18.6 dB |
      | 31 | 114 | 2.3x | -36 dB |
      | 47 | 34 | 0.7x, silent | -55 dB |

      **The inversion is confirmed rather than assumed** - 0 really is loudest,
      and the measured points track the 1.16 dB/step model closely (predicted
      10034/1174/158/19). A claim of the *opposite* was raised on 2026-08-28
      from a user report and was wrong; the report had been mis-sequenced
      against the mixer state. Recorded because the earlier "proof" of the
      inversion was circular - it diffed TortOS's own writes across a volume-up
      press, which shows what TortOS does and not what the codec does. This is
      the non-circular version.

      **The consequence is TortOS's, not Diatom's.** `apply_volume` spreads 21
      positions linearly across the whole 73 dB register, 3.65 dB per press, so
      60% of the shelf's scale is -29 dB and 25% is inaudible. That is the
      loudness complaint Eric actually raised. Handed over in
      `TortOS/VOLUME-CURVE.md`.
- [ ] **[OPEN]** `SET_AUDIO_BUFFER_STATUS_CALLBACK` (cmd 62, offered by 3 of 6
      cores) is **not implemented** - the core-side half of DRC, letting a core
      throttle itself on buffer occupancy. Host-side DRC works without it, so
      this is an improvement rather than a gap.
- [x] **[OPEN]** **`audio_write` overshot its own capacity** - 4927 against a
      stated 4096, invisible to a controller that clamps its error at capacity.
      Fixed by taking only what fits; the write returns what it took, so
      refusals are counted. **Verified on hardware 2026-08-25**: nothing audible
      is attributable to Diatom. [log](discussion/2026-08-25-audio-queue.md).
- [x] **[OPEN]** ~~GBA is the best test case.~~ Superseded by measurement: the
      hardest case is **PAL at 50.0070 Hz on a 60 Hz panel** (FCEUmm, Snes9x),
      and the most awkward *rate* is mGBA's **65536 Hz**. Use both as
      conformance targets, not GBA alone.
- [x] **[LB]** **PAL conformance holds on device** - Probotector at 50.0070 fps
      on a 60.9 Hz panel: **50.01 fps, 0 resyncs, drift -0.284%**. Pacing to the
      core's clock is measured, not argued. The hardest ratio found since is
      mGBA given **Game Boy** content, which reports **131072 Hz** - 2.73:1, and
      still holds. Detail and the correction that found it:
      [brick port log](discussion/2026-08-24-brick-port.md).
- [x] **[OPEN]** **Loudness differs by system - measured 2026-08-28, and the
      framing was wrong.** Nine runs, five cores, 1200 frames each, `audio IN`
      RMS off the mixer input:

      | run | IN rms | run | IN rms |
      |---|---|---|---|
      | nes-advisl | 4279 | nes-1943 | 2036 |
      | snes-starfox | 3628 | pce-aero | 1646 |
      | gba-advwars | 3313 | pce-airzonk | 1398 |
      | gen-psiv | 2629 | snes-parodius | 954 |

      A 4.5x spread, about 13 dB, so the complaint is real. **But the spread
      WITHIN a system is as large as the spread between them** - NES 2036-4279,
      SNES 954-3628. Parodius is the quietest thing measured and has nearly the
      highest peak, so it is dynamic range, not level.

      **That rules out the fix anyone would reach for first.** A per-system gain
      table would be wrong for half of each system's library, and it was already
      the one shape §12 forbids. Nothing static works here.

      Recommendation on record: **do not build normalization.** Dynamic AGC is
      the only thing that would work, it would pump on exactly the content that
      motivated it, and it changes what the core produced. If it is ever
      revisited it wants an ADR, not a patch.

      **The loudness Eric actually noticed was not this.** It was TortOS's
      volume curve - see the gain-curve item below.
- [x] **[OPEN]** **The GBA stutter was a log file**, not audio. mGBA logs every
      DMA at INFO and `core_log` had no level filter, so under the launcher it
      wrote thousands of lines a second to the SD card - 43.18 fps against
      59.7275, 68 resyncs, and a queue minimum of 0, which is a real underrun.
      Fixed by dropping core DEBUG/INFO once a game starts.
      [what it cost to find](discussion/2026-08-28-gba-stutter.md)
- [ ] **[OPEN]** **The SNES half was never reproduced.** Parodius and Star Fox
      measured clean, and the chatty core above is mGBA specifically - nothing
      in the log came from `snes9x2010`. Either a different fault, or the same
      one seen through a different game. Needs a report against a named title
      before it is worth chasing.
- [ ] **[NOT PLANNED]** Miniloong's 120Hz panel is a clean 2× - does that
      change the answer per device, and does the port get a say? Parked with
      the Miniloong port itself (§4); unanswerable without the hardware in the
      build matrix.
- [x] **[OPEN]** vsync → **yes on the Brick, and unavoidable**:
      `FBIOPAN_DISPLAY` is a vsync-latched blocking flip
      ([ADR-0013](decisions/0013-brick-fbdev-flip-thread.md)), which is why the
      flip runs on its own thread behind a latest-wins mailbox rather than
      blocking the frame loop. On desktop it is deliberately **off**, per the
      1.4% deficit above. No tearing observed on the panel.
- [x] **[OPEN]** **The end-of-session fps line counted menu time as slow
      frames.** `t_start` was set once at load and never rebased, so the rate
      was frames over wall clock. Pacing already rebased `next_us` on resume for
      exactly this reason; the summary was simply never told.

      Found by the launcher 2026-08-27 in its own device logs, where a session
      read **"364 frames in 25.20s = 14.44 fps"** against a 60.0998 target. That
      was six seconds of play and nineteen of menu, and it felt fine to play.

      Menu time is now accumulated and excluded, and the amount is **printed
      rather than silently subtracted** so the line cannot be misread as wall
      clock by someone who does not know it is not.

      **This mattered more than a cosmetic log fix.** §6 has an open item on
      stuttering, raised the same day. A rate line reading less than half its
      target is a compelling trail, and it was pointing at nothing. The clean
      instrument already existed - the per-display-mode line below it is
      per-frame and was never affected.

- [x] **[OPEN]** **Where does audio go when the device has more than one
      output?** → **[ADR-0029](decisions/0029-audio-output-is-a-state.md)**
      *(Superseded by 0030)*. A fifth state on ADR-0020's plane: the launcher
      owns which device, the port owns opening it, and a failed or lost sink
      falls back to the default rather than ending the game. Raised by TortOS
      gaining a Bluetooth sink on 2026-09-03 with nothing to route to it.

- [x] **[OPEN]** **Can SDL drive the sink it is handed?** →
      **[ADR-0030](decisions/0030-audio-output-remeasured.md)** *(Accepted)*.
      Not a `bluealsa:DEV=...` string - SDL opens it and never writes, and the
      close never returns. A named PCM drains and closes in ~105 ms. 0029's
      decision survives; three of its facts did not, and volume for a sink
      returns as a third window (0..127, not inverted). Not implemented.

- [x] **[LB]** **Who owns the hardware mute switch, and who may undo it?** →
      **[ADR-0031](decisions/0031-mute-is-a-state-the-launcher-owns.md)**
      *(Accepted)*. The launcher cuts `HpSpeaker Switch`, which is below the
      mixer and silences every producer. This port may cut it for its own level
      0 and must never re-enable it while muted; `SETMUTE` says which. Measured,
      and not implemented here yet - the exit path re-enables it today.

- [x] **[OPEN]** **Can the launcher silence the game and not the music?** →
      **[ADR-0032](decisions/0032-quiet-the-game-in-its-own-stream.md)**
      *(Accepted)*. `SETQUIET on=1|0`: faded silence in place of the game's
      samples, after the resampler. Built 2026-09-18: on the Brick a game under
      music sent 0 of 1360466 samples non-zero, and Eric heard no click at the
      10 ms fade. check-stateplane reads the fade back from the tap.

## 8. Input

- [x] **[LB]** Where physical→retropad mapping lives → **split in two.** The
      port turns device events into canonical Diatom buttons
      ([ADR-0007](decisions/0007-port-interface.md)); `env.c` maps those to
      retropad, a near-identity whose purpose is keeping `libretro.h` out of the
      port. Device quirks resolve in the port and never travel upward.
- [x] **[LB]** Where button remapping belongs →
      **[ADR-0019](decisions/0019-input-mapping-and-remapping.md)** *(Accepted)*;
      how it arrives → **[ADR-0020](decisions/0020-shared-state-plane.md)**
      *(Accepted)*. Two translations, never collapsed: the port owns
      physical→canonical and is never configurable, the host owns
      canonical→retropad as **data**, the launcher owns the config.
- [x] **[LB]** **The physical switch is out of scope, reserved for the
      launcher** (2026-08-25, judgment call). `gpio243`: unclaimed, no bounce,
      `edge` present so it can be interrupt-driven, unreferenced by TortOS. It
      is **state, not events** - it has a value before Diatom starts and after
      it exits. Diatom must not learn it exists; any per-game meaning arrives as
      a protocol message, not a button.
- [x] **[OPEN]** `SET_INPUT_DESCRIPTORS` is **captured and served** as
      `INPUTS`/`INPUT`, reporting canonical buttons rather than retropad ids so
      labels track the active remap for free. Verified on hardware 2026-08-26:
      FCEUmm's own labels, and `x` reading "Turbo A" before a remap and "B"
      after → **[ADR-0020](decisions/0020-shared-state-plane.md)** *(Accepted)*.
- [x] **[OPEN]** MENU is Diatom's own key and never reaches a core. The port
      reports it and does not act on it: standalone it ends the session, under
      the launcher it hands over the display (ADR-0016). The L3/R3 worry is
      handled in the port - the Brick's front keys report as
      `BTN_THUMBL`/`THUMBR` and stay unmapped.
- [x] **[OPEN]** Where frontend hotkeys (not gameplay remapping) live →
      **[ADR-0035](decisions/0035-hotkey-submenu-lives-on-select.md)**
      *(Accepted)*. SELECT, held, extending `display_chord`'s existing
      convention - not MENU, which ADR-0014 left open and this rejects to
      avoid a latency regression on MENU's existing instant-open behavior.
      `hotkeys.c`/`.h` hold the table; `hotkey_chord()` checks it.
- [x] **[OPEN]** A device with a spare key (the GKD's Home) gets a second
      modifier → **[ADR-0037](decisions/0037-home-is-a-second-modifier-key.md)**
      *(Accepted)*. `DIATOM_BTN_HOTKEY` is an alias of SELECT-as-modifier for
      both chords; never reaches a core, unmappable. MENU still is not one.
- [x] **[OPEN]** Which key is the hotkey modifier →
      **[ADR-0038](decisions/0038-the-hotkey-modifier-is-chosen-default-menu.md)**
      *(Accepted)*. The player chooses, and the default is MENU. That reverses
      ADR-0035's rejection of MENU: SELECT as the modifier cost every game a
      holdable SELECT, and the menu opening on release is the accepted price
      (plorpos-gkd.43.1).
- [x] **[OPEN]** Hotkeys without the modifier, and directions as triggers →
      **[ADR-0039](decisions/0039-direct-hotkeys-and-distinct-stick-directions.md)**
      *(Accepted)*. `d.x:ff` is a direct trigger, hidden from the game every
      frame. Directions bind with the modifier only, and the stick gets its own
      bits, folded onto the d-pad for the core (plorpos-gkd.43.2).
- [x] **[LB]** **Volume keys work during a game**, handled in the port and
      never reported upward. 20 steps of 5%; level 0 cuts `HpSpeaker Switch`
      because `digital volume` advertises `mute=0` - its minimum is ~-74 dB,
      not silence. Feedback is a 6px bar matching the device UI. Verified on
      hardware: silent at zero, no pop returning.
      [analysis](discussion/2026-08-25-volume-ownership.md).
- [x] **[LB]** **Levels survive the exit, from both sides** →
      **[ADR-0020](decisions/0020-shared-state-plane.md)**. A level is a
      fraction (`index=` with `count=`), and TortOS sends SETLEVEL at launch
      and lands LEVEL events in libmsettings when EXIT returns ownership -
      closed 2026-08-26 by its migration. History and the ladder mismatch:
      [measurement](spikes/2026-08-26-backlight-floor.md).
- [x] **[OPEN]** **Brightness works during a game** too - front keys
      (`BTN_THUMBL`/`THUMBR`, SDL 9/10), 20 steps sharing volume's scale, via
      `DISP_LCD_SET_BRIGHTNESS` on `/dev/disp` (no `/sys/class/backlight` on
      this device). Same bar as volume, verified.
- [x] **[OPEN]** **The panel's floor is raw 2**, measured 2026-08-26 - 0 and 1
      read as black. The disp2 driver clamps nothing and accepts a true 0, so
      the port's clamp is load-bearing. `BRIGHT_RAW_MIN 8` was chosen rather
      than measured and landed on TortOS's level 1 by luck.
      [measurement](spikes/2026-08-26-backlight-floor.md)
- [x] **[OPEN]** **Brightness is a geometric ladder, not a linear ramp** -
      `2 4 8 16 32 48 72 96 128 160 192 255`, twelve rungs, the launcher's own
      spacing extended down to the measured floor. Verified even on hardware
      in Contra 2026-08-26. Ten of the twelve are values the launcher also has
      a level for. Step count remains launcher policy.
      [measurement](spikes/2026-08-26-backlight-floor.md)
- [x] **[LB]** Analog sticks: **no analog support at all** →
      **[ADR-0003](decisions/0003-digital-only-input.md)** *(Accepted)*
- [x] **[OPEN]** Button count is **not** a constraint. Six is the maximum any
      in-scope system asks (SNES, 6-button Genesis, CPS2), covered by the
      standard 4+L1/R1 mapping - the same layout SNES uses. An earlier claim
      that six-button games map "badly" was wrong.
- [x] **[OPEN]** L2/R2 report as **axes, not keys** - `ABS_Z` and `ABS_RZ`,
      SDL axes 2 and 5, resting at -32768 and slamming to +32767. Digital
      switches in axis clothing. Measured 2026-08-24, handled in `brick.c`
      since, and re-confirmed from raw evdev 2026-08-25 (0 to 255 to 0). The
      KEY mask having no `BTN_TL2`/`TR2` is why, and is not evidence of absence.
- [x] **[OPEN]** Same curation on both devices? **Probably yes.** With no analog,
      the two devices are input-equivalent, so one test matrix rather than two.
      (Follows from ADR-0003; revisit if the class widens.)
- [x] **[LB]** Controller **device-type** selection - required, and done:
      `set_controller_port_device(0, RETRO_DEVICE_JOYPAD)` at load. Genesis 3-
      vs 6-button is correctness, not preference - some early games misbehave
      with a 6-button pad, which is why the real pad has a Mode switch. Digital-
      only removed axes, not device types; a non-default type is a core option.
- [x] **[OPEN]** Brick physical controls → **measured 2026-08-24**, firmware
      1.1.1, every cap pressed in a known order twice under `DIATOM_INPUT_DEBUG`.
      The map is in `brick.c`. Worth keeping the reason it was measured rather
      than reasoned: **X and Y are the opposite way round from their positions**
      - the top cap emits `BTN_WEST`, the left cap `BTN_NORTH` - and positional
      reasoning got exactly those two wrong. No analog, confirming §0b.
- [x] **[OPEN]** **Turbo is a pulse on a map binding**, `SETMAP map=x:a~3`,
      host-side, port untouched. Eight of ten systems have two face buttons so
      X and Y are spare; core options reach two of them and disagree (measured
      2026-08-31: `genesis_plus_gx` and `mgba` declare none). Costs `proto=3` →
      **[ADR-0028](decisions/0028-turbo-is-a-property-of-a-binding.md)**
      *(Accepted)*.

### Test matrix - *not* a core list

**Diatom has no core list and no system list.** It loads whatever core it is
handed. The table below is the set Diatom is **verified against**, so its
envelope and geometry assumptions have evidence behind them. Which core actually
covers which system is the host application's config decision - for TortOS,
`systems.cfg`. See `working-agreement.md`.

Systems in scope by the criteria in
[ADR-0005](decisions/0005-system-inclusion-criteria.md); the list moves without
superseding it.

**32X is out** (2026-08-25). ADR-0005 never mentioned it - not In, not Out, not
even Unasked - so this is a list movement, not an amendment to the criteria.
Reasoning, worst argument first:

1. **Rule 1 is ambiguous.** Knuckles' Chaotix and Kolibri are 2D, but the
   titles the hardware exists for - Virtua Racing Deluxe, Virtua Fighter, Doom -
   are pseudo-3D. The rule does not cleanly decide it.
2. **Rule 3 was never measured.** Dual SH-2 at 23 MHz on a Cortex-A53 is a real
   question and no 32X ROM was available to answer it. Now moot.
3. **The decisive argument is cost against library.** Only PicoDrive supports
   32X, and PicoDrive lost the Sega comparison on correctness. Including 32X
   means carrying a **sixth core solely for it** - which is exactly the shape
   OpenEmu adopted, GPGX for the Sega block plus a 32X-only PicoDrive. The
   library is roughly 40 titles across a 14-month commercial life, most of them
   enhanced Genesis ports.

A system whose support costs an entire extra core, to serve ~40 mostly-ported
games, fails the spirit of the criteria even where the letter is unclear.

**Still unasked** from ADR-0005's original list: Lynx, Sega CD, Atari 7800.
Master System, Game Gear and Game Boy / GBC have since moved In and are in the
table below. Note that Sega CD brings the Disk Control Interface with it - 21
multi-disc titles - so it is not free despite `genesis_plus_gx` covering it.

| System | Max ROM | Integer scale |
|---|---|---|
| NES | ~1 MB | 3× → 768×720 |
| Master System | ~1 MB | 4× on Brick (1024×768 exact), 3× on Miniloong |
| Game Gear | ~1 MB | 5× → 800×720 |
| PC Engine (HuCard) | ~1 MB | 3× → 768×717 |
| PC Engine CD | - | 3× |
| Genesis | 4 MB (8 max) | 3× → 960×672 |
| SNES | 6 MB | 3× → 768×672 |
| Game Boy / GBC | ~8 MB | 5× → 800×720 |
| GBA | 32 MB | 4× → 960×640 |

Largest ROM is GBA's 32 MB, so the
[ADR-0006](decisions/0006-keep-all-cores-resident.md) envelope holds regardless
of which cores a host chooses. **Cores, not systems, are the cost unit** - one
core routinely covers several systems, so adding a system is often free.

**Why each core was chosen or rejected:
[docs/reference/core-selection.md](reference/core-selection.md)** - the matrix,
everything tested and dropped, and the measurement behind each call.

**Cores verified against so far**: `fceumm`, `gambatte`, `snes9x`,
`picodrive`, `genesis_plus_gx`, `mednafen_pce_fast`, `mgba` - provenance and
hashes in [CORES.md](../CORES.md), fetched from libretro's buildbot by
`tools/fetch-cores.sh`.

**Coverage as measured** (2026-08-25): one Sega core covers Genesis, Master
System and Game Gear, and mGBA covers Game Boy, GBC and GBA. That is **five
cores for all nine systems**, against six covering six before. Master System
and Game Gear had no assigned core at all until now.

**For the Sega block, use `genesis_plus_gx`** - see the
[core comparison](spikes/2026-08-25-sega-core-comparison.md). Not a performance
call: both hold frame rate with 0 resyncs. PicoDrive reports a fixed 320x240 for
every system, so Game Gear arrives double-scaled and distorted; Genesis Plus GX
reports true geometry, giving an exact 5x for Game Gear and a 1024x768 whole-
panel fill for Master System. Costs a 12.6 MB core and ~1 MB save states.
PicoDrive is not needed: **32X is out of scope** (decided 2026-08-25), so
`genesis_plus_gx` is the Sega core unconditionally.

**gpSP is not needed** (measured 2026-08-25). It is on the buildbot for
aarch64 and it is C, so it would run where the C++ cores do not - but it covers
GBA only, so it cannot replace mGBA, only add a sixth core. And mGBA does not
need help: 900 frames each of Golden Sun, Pokemon Emerald, Boktai and Super
Mario Advance 2, all **59.73 fps against 59.7275 with 0 resyncs**. gpSP becomes
relevant only if a GBA title is found that mGBA cannot hold.

**Gambatte is redundant, not missing.** mGBA covers GB and GBC identically -
160x144, aspect 1.1111, 59.7275 fps, exact 5x integer - and opens a `.gb` ROM in
625 ms, the same as the lightest core in the matrix, from a binary 47% smaller
than Gambatte's. Only `snes9x` is a real gap.

**Per-launch cost is dominated by ROM size, not core choice** (measured): 625 ms
for a 32 KB ROM against 750 ms for a 16 MB one, on the same core. Core binary
size only shows up on the first launch after boot, because ADR-0006 keeps cores
resident and never calls `dlclose`.

**SNES uses `snes9x2010`**, not mainline - see the
[SNES core selection](spikes/2026-08-25-snes-core-selection.md). Mainline,
`mesen-s` and `mednafen_supafaust` are all C++ against `GLIBCXX_3.4.29` or
newer and cannot load on the Brick's 3.4.28. Of the four pure-C snes9x forks
that do run, only `snes9x2010` reports the correct **50.0070** PAL rate; 2002
and 2005 say 50.3197, which paces PAL content 0.62% fast. `bsnes_mercury_balanced`
loads and reports the most faithful numbers of any candidate, and manages
**36.56 fps with 78 resyncs** - out on measurement.

**PC Engine CD needs no Disk Control Interface** (measured 2026-08-25). ADR-0005
listed multi-disc support as an open requirement; a 25-title PCE CD collection
contains **zero** disc-numbered files and **zero** `.m3u` playlists. The
environment spike already found `mednafen_pce_fast` asking for the interface,
being declined, and carrying on. Multi-disc is a fifth-generation problem -
Super CD-ROM discs held ~540 MB and PCE CD content ran 200-400 MB.

**Confirmed against Redump** (libretro-database, 2026-08-25): the PC Engine CD
catalog is **502 entries with zero disc-numbered titles**. No multi-disc PCE CD
game was ever released. The convention is demonstrably in use in the same
dataset - PlayStation has 7,186 disc-numbered entries of 13,592 - so this is a
real null rather than missing metadata.

That leaves **System Card BIOS handling as the only real PCE CD work**: load it,
and fail clearly rather than mysteriously when it is missing.

**Sega CD is the opposite** and would need the Disk Control Interface: 260 of its
544 Redump entries are disc-numbered. So if Sega CD ever comes off the unasked
list, that work arrives with it - which is an argument for deciding the two
together rather than assuming `genesis_plus_gx` covering Sega CD makes it free.

**Multi-disc arrived with the PlayStation** (plorpos-gkd.47, 2026-10-03).
Measured on the GKD with `envlog` and a two-CHD `.m3u`: `pcsx_rearmed` asks
`GET_DISK_CONTROL_INTERFACE_VERSION` inside `retro_init` and declares v0 when
refused, EXT when told 1. Diatom now answers 1 and keeps the interface on the
core, which is resident and will not declare it again. The state plane gains
`DISC` / `SETDISC index=`, RUN gains `disc=` so a resumed game starts on the
disc it was left on, and READY says `proto=7`. A swap opens the tray and
selects at once; the tray closes after 60 frames of play, so a game polling
the lid sees it open. Sega CD through `genesis_plus_gx` takes the same path,
unmeasured.

**The coprocessor risk ADR-0005 flagged did not materialize** (measured
2026-08-25): Star Fox and Stunt Race FX (SuperFX), Yoshi's Island (SA-1), Super
Mario Kart (DSP-1) and Mega Man X2 (CX4) all hold full speed with 0 resyncs on
both `snes9x2010` and `snes9x2005_plus`. The A53 carries every coprocessor in
the library. `snes9x2010` still wins on reported timing: 60.0985 NTSC against
2005_plus's 59.9227, matching the PAL divergence, so the light forks are wrong
about both standards.

**Nothing needs building.** The matrix is five fetched cores covering nine
systems. The ADR-0012 container's C++ path is verified (`GLIBCXX_3.4.28`) and
currently unused - it is the answer if a future system needs a modern C++ core.

These six were a **convenience sample** - binaries already on disk from a NextUI
release - not a recommendation and not the available set. libretro cores are
independent upstream binaries; Eric already builds his own via `libretro-super`.
Substituting `genesis_plus_gx` for `picodrive`, or a lighter `snes9x` fork, is a
host decision and only means re-running the spike, which is cheap.

- [x] **[OPEN]** ~~Verify against a second core for at least one system.~~
      **Done 2026-08-24**: Genesis Plus GX v1.7.4 alongside PicoDrive 2.05 on
      the same Genesis game. The seam held - an unfamiliar core ran at its own
      59.9227 fps with 0 resyncs and no code changes - while the two cores
      disagreed about geometry, aspect, frame rate, SRAM size, state size and
      serialization quirks. Exactly the diversity the check existed to find.
- [x] **[OPEN]** Verify against a second core for at least one system →
      **done, and it paid.** Sega ran under both PicoDrive and Genesis Plus GX,
      SNES under five snes9x forks and bsnes. That comparison is what exposed
      PicoDrive reporting a fixed 320x240 for every system, the light forks
      misreporting both PAL and NTSC rates, and saves not transferring between
      cores for the same game (§5).
- [x] **[OPEN]** SNES coprocessors → **measured 2026-08-25 on the Brick, and
      the risk did not materialize.** Star Fox and Stunt Race FX (SuperFX),
      Yoshi's Island (SA-1), Super Mario Kart (DSP-1) and Mega Man X2 (CX4) all
      hold full speed with 0 resyncs on `snes9x2010`. The A53 carries every
      coprocessor in the library, so ADR-0005's warning about them is retired.

- [x] **[OPEN]** **Input held across the menu reached the core** - dismissing
      the in-game menu with A put an A into the game, a stray jump on every
      dismissal. Reported by the launcher 2026-08-27, fixed the same day.

      `prev_buttons` was already re-read at resume, for exactly this reason and
      with a human-measured comment saying so. It protects every *edge*-
      triggered consumer - MENU cannot reopen, the chord does not re-fire - and
      the core is the one consumer that reads the **level**, in
      `cb_input_state`. So the one guard in place missed the one consumer that
      mattered.

      `menu_pause` blocks in `proto_poll` and never polls the pad, so the whole
      menu session's events queue and land in a single drain at resume. Nothing
      in that batch was aimed at the game.

      Fixed with a latch, suppressed until genuine **release**. Narrowing it to
      buttons that went down *while paused* is more precise-looking and has a
      hole: release A during the menu, press it again to choose Continue, and it
      was held before the menu too. The cost of the conservative reading is
      holding a direction across a menu, which self-corrects on the next press.

      **The fix had to move `diatom_env_suppress` to a single writer.**
      `display_chord` set the mask absolutely every frame, `suppress(0)`
      included, so any second reason to hide a button was cleared on the next
      frame SELECT was not held. It now returns its mask and the loop composes
      the two. Two masks with different lifetimes in one variable is the actual
      defect; the stray A was a symptom of it.

      **Verified on hardware 2026-08-27, behaviorally.** `edf083f` confirmed
      *running* rather than merely deployed - `/proc/5611/exe` md5
      `5b02f1e1d9ef04e91eb9ad6ba9ec2b5d`, against launcher `905fd7e5` - and
      driven by a human on a real game. Two checks: dismissing the menu with A
      puts no stray input in the game, and a direction held across the menu
      still works on its next press rather than being stranded suppressed. The
      second one is the one that mattered, because the conservative latch is
      what could have broken it.

      **Not instrumented, and the distinction is kept on purpose.** Nobody
      watched the resume frame with `DIATOM_INPUT_DEBUG` on. What is established
      is that the symptom is gone and the fix strands nothing - not that the
      core saw no A on that specific frame. Deliberate: the behavioral checks
      answer the question a player has and cost ten seconds, against taking over
      the resident in a foreground adb session while someone is using the
      device. Frame-level evidence can still be had if anything here is ever
      doubted.
- [x] **[OPEN]** **The same leak at game start**, reported 2026-08-27, hours
      after the fix above. Pressing A on the shelf to launch fired a weapon in
      the game. Fixed the same night; the entry point above covered menu resume
      and this is its sibling.

      `run_session_inner` went from the warmup straight into the loop with
      `prev_buttons` still 0 and no mask set, so a button held at launch read as
      a fresh edge *and* as a level. The resume site did all three things -
      poll, seed `prev_buttons`, set the mask - and the start site did none.

      **The mask has to be set before the warmup, not after.** The warmup calls
      `retro_run` three times and the core polls the pad from inside it, via
      `cb_input_poll`, so the core reads the pad on the very first warmup frame.
      A mask set after the warmup would leak on exactly the frames it exists to
      protect. The launcher raised this as a question it could not answer from
      outside and it was the right question.

      **It also closes a stale-mask bug nobody had reported.** `g_suppress` is
      static and the resident process never reset it between games, so quitting
      with SELECT held carried that suppression into the next game's warmup.
      Found while placing this fix rather than by anyone hitting it.

      The latch is named `held_at_entry` rather than `held_at_resume` now, since
      it covers both doors.

      **Diatom's, not the launcher's**, and the launcher made the argument
      against its own alternative: holding RUN until release would put a
      human-scale delay on the launch path, which is the one number this
      project is built around - warm launch to `RUNNING` is ~6 ms. Suppression
      costs nothing and starts immediately.

      **Verified on hardware 2026-08-28**, behaviorally, on `9ff8324`
      (`/proc/6596/exe` md5 `021a0b114372d9ea2991bca480fed2a2`). Launching with
      A puts nothing in the game, and the conservative latch strands nothing.
      Not instrumented, for the same reason as the resume fix above.

**Genesis note:** launched 3-button in 1988; the 6-button pad arrived 1993 and
most of the library predates it. Both fit 4 face + L1/R1. Requires
`retro_set_controller_port_device` - some early games misbehave with a 6-button
pad attached, which is why the real pad has a Mode switch.

## 9. State and storage

- [x] **[LB]** Saves, save states, slots and ownership →
      **[ADR-0016](decisions/0016-saves-and-save-states.md)** *(Accepted)*.
      SRAM automatic; five manual slots plus a separate resume slot; resume is
      the default at launch; Diatom takes paths and never slot numbers.
- [x] **[OPEN]** Manual slots and the in-game menu → built and verified on
      hardware. MENU pauses and blocks; the launcher answers `RESUME`, `SAVE`,
      `LOAD` or `STOP`, and slot naming stays entirely in the launcher as
      ADR-0016 requires. The handoff it rests on is in §3.
      [protocol log](discussion/2026-08-25-protocol.md).
- [x] **[OPEN]** **`PREVIEW` is emitted** →
      **[ADR-0024](decisions/0024-session-persistence-paths.md)** *(Accepted)*.
      RUN carries `resume=`/`exit_state=`/`preview=`; the preview is the core's
      frame (172 KB, not 2.3 MB of panel), written at pause and exit, announced
      before EXIT. Verified on hardware: two Contra sessions, the second
      resuming the first's state, artifacts at TortOS's exact paths.
- [x] **[LB]** Rewind: support or drop? Real RAM cost on a 1GB device →
      **[ADR-0034](decisions/0034-fast-forward-and-rewind.md)** *(Accepted)*.
      Support it. RAM cost is a budgeted placeholder (8 MiB, uncompressed,
      re-sized against the live core's `serialize_size()`), not a measured
      one - no per-core state size exists yet for the actual target device.
      *(Since measured and compressed: plorpos-gkd.59, see ADR-0034.)*
- [ ] **[OPEN]** **NGPC has no battery saves, only states.** Measured
      2026-09-01 on Dark Arms and Metal Slug - 1st Mission, both of which save
      on real hardware: `mednafen_ngp` reports `retro_get_memory_size(SAVE_RAM)`
      as **0**, so Diatom logs "no battery in this game" and writes no `.srm`.
      The core writes nothing of its own either - nothing appeared under
      `Saves/` after a session. Not player-visible today, because autosave
      writes a state on every exit; it bites only when someone loads an older
      manual slot, which rewinds the cartridge save with everything else.

      Open before this is called settled: **does RACE expose SAVE_RAM?** It is
      the other NGP/NGPC core, equally GPLv2 and equally on the buildbot, passed
      over for Beetle NeoPop on accuracy grounds when saves were not yet known
      to differ. The only way to find out is to point a host at it and launch
      the same two carts.
- [x] **[OPEN]** **Zipped content loads** - one ROM per archive, extracted by
      the host (largest entry, stored or deflate, zlib by dlopen so nothing
      links it); need_fullpath cores get it staged to tmpfs. Found by the
      FIRST game a real launcher handed over: TortOS's whole library is
      zipped, protodrive's never was - the stand-in failure §13 predicted,
      arriving in under a minute of first contact.
- [x] **[OPEN]** CD support → done for PC Engine. **CHD needs nothing** - read
      natively at 59.81 fps against a 59.8200 target, 0 resyncs. The System Card
      is named by the launcher →
      **[ADR-0017](decisions/0017-firmware-is-declared-not-known.md)**. CUE/BIN
      **untested**. Sega CD would also need the Disk Control Interface.

## 10. Residency and lifecycle - the genuinely novel part

- [x] **[LB]** **What a warm launch costs** - **~35 ms for NES, ~200 ms for a
      32 MB GBA title**, against 625-750 ms cold. ADR-0006 and ADR-0008 are now
      justified by measurement rather than assumption, and ADR-0009 is what
      delivers it. [warm launch](spikes/2026-08-25-warm-launch.md).

### RESOLVED 2026-08-23 → [ADR-0006](decisions/0006-keep-all-cores-resident.md)

**`dlopen` every core and never `dlclose`. `retro_init` only the one in use.**

A proposal of 2026-08-22 - *one core resident, exit the process on system
switch* - was **rejected**. It bounded memory when Neo Geo was still a
candidate; [ADR-0005](decisions/0005-system-inclusion-criteria.md) excluded Neo
Geo, removing the problem it solved. It also paid ~170 ms plus a process restart
on every system switch, against the snappiness goal.

Eviction, LRU and tiering are all unnecessary. The three `dlclose` hazards -
static TLS silently preventing unload, cores leaking across reloads, glibc not
returning heap to the OS - become non-problems rather than risks, because the
operation never occurs.

- [x] **[LB]** Residency policy → ADR-0006 *(Accepted)*
- [x] **[OPEN]** `dlclose` measurement - **no longer required.** Retired from the
      phase exit criteria; Diatom never calls it.
- [x] **[OPEN]** Measured on the Brick 2026-08-23 →
      [spike result](spikes/2026-08-23-rss-and-dlopen.md).

      **6 cores mapped + 1 running = 15.0 MB.** Trigger is 250 MB; RAM is 975 MB.
      Residency was never close to a memory problem - ~2 MB resident per mapped
      core, ~2 MB more for the loaded game.

      **The ADR-0006 estimate was wrong by 10×** (~150 MB predicted). A mapped
      `.so` costs far less RSS than its file size, because only touched pages
      become resident. Wrong in the safe direction, but it was a guess with a
      number attached.

      **The trigger is badly calibrated as a result** - at 250 MB against a
      150 MB estimate, it needs a 16× regression to fire. ~50 MB would mean
      something. Noted rather than superseding ADR-0006, whose decision is
      confirmed.

      `dlopen`: **232 ms cold for all six, 35 ms warm.** Page-cache state changes
      time, not RSS. Does **not** reproduce TortOS's `~170 ms` per-core figure
      (worst cold case here is 70 ms) - recorded as a discrepancy, since the two
      measurements differ in context and I cannot say why from here.

      FCEUmm executes at **1.81 ms/frame** against a 20.0 ms PAL budget - ~9%,
      core execution only, no scaling/blit/audio. RSS identical after 120 and
      720 frames: no leak observed in that span.
- [x] **[LB]** `nm -D` check - **DONE 2026-08-23. ADR-0006's revisit trigger
      fired.** → **[ADR-0010](decisions/0010-rtld-local-is-mandatory.md)**
      *(Accepted)*

      | Core | Exports | `retro_*` | Other |
      |---|---|---|---|
      | fceumm | 45 | 45 | 0 |
      | gambatte | 46 | 46 | 0 |
      | mednafen_pce_fast | 53 | 53 | 0 |
      | mgba | 25 | 25 | 0 |
      | snes9x | 27 | 27 | 0 |
      | **picodrive** | **1115** | 46 | **1069** |

      PicoDrive exports a complete statically-linked zlib (`crc32`, `inflate`,
      `deflate`, `gzopen`, …) plus ~1000 internal names generic enough to
      collide - `Pico`, `cdd`, `ssp`, `decode`, `tcache`, `MyFree`, `g_argv`.

      **ADR-0006's decision stands; one supporting claim does not.** The `nm`
      check was described there as proving an empty collision surface, "a
      stronger guarantee" than `RTLD_LOCAL`. False in general. `RTLD_LOCAL` is
      the *only* mechanism - hence ADR-0010.

      A property of the **build**, not the emulator: the same source with
      `-fvisibility=hidden` would be clean. No core's exports can be assumed.
      The check is retained as advisory.

      fceumm 45, mednafen_pce_fast 53 and mgba 25 match TortOS's earlier counts
      exactly - independent corroboration.

---

## 11. Memory discipline (the project's thesis)

- [x] **[OPEN]** Measurement harness → `tools/rssprobe.c`, per-core RSS deltas
      around `dlopen` / `retro_init` / `retro_load_game`. Every residency number
      in §10 comes from it.
- [x] **[OPEN]** Core-side allocations → measured rather than accounted for.
      **6 cores mapped + 1 running = 15.0 MB** against 975 MB of RAM
      ([spike](spikes/2026-08-23-rss-and-dlopen.md)), and RSS was identical
      after 120 and 720 frames, so nothing observable leaks in that span. The
      instrument is the accounting; there is no way to do it from inside.
- [x] **[LB]** **RSS budget: 24 MB, asserted** by `tools/conform-device.sh`.
      Measured 2026-08-26 on hardware: **8.2-8.4 MB** peak with FCEUmm loaded
      and running, flat across 300, 600 and 1200 frames. One ceiling covers the
      heaviest configuration shipped too, since rssprobe puts six cores mapped
      with one running at 15.0 MB. ADR-0006's 250 MB stands as its own trigger
      and is 30x this; the budget that would notice a regression is this one.
- [x] **[OPEN]** **No malloc in the frame loop - verified, and stronger than
      the claim.** Diatom allocates **3 times in its entire life** (126 kB) and
      frees all three, identical at 300 and 600 frames. `tools/allocwatch.c`
      wraps malloc at link time, so it counts Diatom's calls and not a
      `dlopen`ed core's - the right boundary, since cores must allocate.

---

## 12. Core options and config

- [x] **[LB]** **Core options implemented** - `src/options.c`, **171 settings
      across five cores, previously all unreachable.** Diatom holds definitions
      and values; the launcher decides them.
      [log](discussion/2026-08-25-core-options.md).
- [x] **[OPEN]** **What the launcher asks for is not what the core currently
      has**, and conflating them was two bugs at once. Found 2026-08-28 when
      TortOS began setting options per launch.

      A core re-declares its options on every `retro_load_game` and
      `define_v2` rebuilds the table at its defaults. So a `SETOPT` for a key
      the core had already declared was written into that table and then wiped
      by the very load it was sent for: **a launcher's option took effect
      exactly once per core per process**, silently, with no log line after the
      first. Meanwhile the pending list, which did survive, was never cleared -
      so `mgba_gb_model=Game Boy` set for a Game Boy folder was re-applied to
      every later load, and Game Boy **Color** titles ran as DMG hardware. A
      `0xC0` cartridge showed its own "only for Game Boy Color" screen.

      Now: the table is the core's **state**, the pending list is the launcher's
      **intent**. Intent is recorded whether or not the key exists yet, survives
      re-declaration, and is dropped when the game ends
      (`diatom_options_clear_pending`). Per-launch is also the right model, not
      just the fixed one - ADR-0009 makes the launcher drive, and an option set
      for one game is not a standing instruction about the next.

      **Fixing one alone would have hidden the other.** Clearing pending without
      recording intent leaves a launcher's options working once per process and
      looking fine, because the first launch is the one anybody checks.

      Verified on hardware. A trap for whoever tests this next, which cost two
      false "still broken" readings: a **resume state carries the machine it
      was made on**, so a `(Restart)` hardware option is overruled on any game
      already played. The log says `state: restored` on the line above, and
      twice that was read as the fix failing.
- [x] **[OPEN]** Surface options over the protocol → done. `OPTIONS` returns a
      count plus one `OPTION` line per setting carrying key, current value,
      default, permitted values and description - everything a menu needs.
      `SETOPT key= value=` sets one, refused if the core does not offer it.
- [x] **[OPEN]** **Option availability can depend on loaded content.** FCEUmm
      declares **0 options at core open and 44 once a ROM is loaded**; the other
      four declare everything at open. So a launcher cannot always show a core's
      options from the shelf - for FCEUmm the list is only complete in-game,
      which fits ADR-0016's in-game menu and rules out a browse-cores options
      screen.

---

## 13. Testing and dev loop

- [x] **[LB]** Desktop backend **first**, before any device work. Held:
      `port/desktop.c` was written before `port/brick.c`, which is what
      kept the seam honest - an interface with one implementation behind
      it grows that implementation's assumptions however carefully it is
      written.
- [x] **[OPEN]** Environment-call logging shim - **DONE 2026-08-23** →
      [spike result](spikes/2026-08-23-env-inventory.md). All six cores, real
      ROMs, full lifecycle, run in an aarch64 container with no device involved.

      **34 of 77 commands appear · ~17 must be implemented · 17 declined by every
      core with nothing breaking · 43 never appear.** The long tail is a
      checklist.

      Consequences recorded below in §5, §6, §7 and §12.
- [x] **[OPEN]** **Headless conformance test** → `make conform-check`
      (`test/conform.py`) and `make conform-device` (`tools/conform-device.sh`).
      Determinism, a frame-count control that proves it can fail, the RSS
      budget, and the allocation count. Not in `make check`: it needs a build
      and runs in real time, ~20s. Both assertions were run to failure on
      purpose before being trusted.
- [ ] **[OPEN]** **The paused loop has no test coverage**, and that is what let
      a real bug live. `test/stateplane.py` exercises DISPLAY and SETDISPLAY
      while running, and pause separately, but never crosses them - so a paused
      loop that enumerated five of the seven state-plane messages and silently
      dropped the other two passed the suite. Found from outside, by the
      launcher, 2026-08-27.

      The gap is structural: pause is entered by a MENU keypress, so a headless
      driver cannot reach `menu_pause` at all. Reaching it would mean an input
      hook in the runtime that exists only for tests, which §0's seam test does
      not obviously justify.

      Closed as a *class* for now instead: the paused loop dispatches through
      `default: state_plane_msg(&m)` exactly as the running loop always has, so
      the next message to join the plane cannot be missed by a stale list. That
      is a structural guarantee rather than an asserted one, which is why no
      test was invented to chase it. Revisit if anything else in that loop needs
      proving, since the reachability problem will be the same.

      **Revisited the same day, and the answer changed.** A second bug in the
      same unreachable region - input held across the menu reaching the core,
      §8 - was also found from outside, by the launcher, hours later. Two
      independent faults in one blind spot in one day is not a coincidence, it
      is a measurement of the blind spot. The argument above ("the structural
      fix is stronger than the test") was right about *that* bug and wrong as a
      general policy: it justifies never testing the region at all.

      Cost of the hook is one synthetic-input entry point on the desktop port,
      test-only. §0's seam test is the thing to argue it against, and the
      counter-argument is now **three** bugs rather than a hypothetical - the
      third arriving the same night, at game start, in the same class as the
      second. **Do this before the next change to the session lifecycle**, not
      after.

      Note the scope that third bug sets: the hook must be able to hold a button
      down *across* `RUN`, the warmup and the first frames, not only across a
      pause. Both leaks were at an entry into game frames, and there are exactly
      two of those.

      **One argument against, raised and then withdrawn.** The launcher offered
      that neither bug is the kind a test finds - both were "a true statement
      nobody could check", the sort a second reader trips over. It withdrew that
      on the grounds that reachability was the only obstacle: both faults were
      trivially testable had the region been reachable. Send SETDISPLAY while
      paused and expect the DISPLAY reply; resume with a button held and expect
      `cb_input_state` to return zero for it. Neither needs cleverness, only a
      way in.

      Kept here as raised-and-withdrawn rather than deleted, because the half
      that survives is worth keeping: the *discovery* was a second reader both
      times, which is a fact about how these were found and not about whether a
      test could have found them. Both remain true - build the hook, and keep
      the outside reader.
- [x] **[OPEN]** **`micprobe --tone` measured room noise for its whole life.**
      The tone was three seconds against a `sleep 5` before the capture, so it
      had ended two seconds before `arecord` started. Every `--tone` reading was
      the room.

      It never looked broken because it returned plausible numbers. It was found
      on 2026-08-28 only because a gain sweep came back **non-monotonic** -
      silence at both ends of the scale and sound in the middle - which is not a
      shape any real attenuator can produce. The tone now covers the whole
      window, and the fixed instrument reproduces a hand-rolled measurement to
      within 3% at both ends.

      **The reference figures in its own header came from the broken path** and
      are marked unverified rather than deleted, since the game path was never
      affected.

      The general lesson is the one this project keeps relearning: a number that
      looks reasonable is not evidence that the thing producing it works. The
      check that caught it was internal consistency, not plausibility.
- [x] **[OPEN]** **The achievement address space is tested offline** →
      `make check-cheevos` (`test/cheevos_test.c`), and it is part of
      `make check`. A RetroAchievements address is an offset into a per-console
      space `rc_consoles.h` defines, not into anything a core hands over, and
      the failure mode of getting it wrong is not a crash - it is a condition
      reading the wrong byte and firing on a game nobody is playing.

      The test builds an NES out of two arrays and checks both mapping paths
      against numbers worked out by hand first: **0x2800 readable in 4 spans**
      with no memory map, **0x4000 in 7 spans** with one, and the mirrors at
      $0800 and $16f3 following $0000 and $06f3 only in the second case. It
      then runs a real condition from Blaster Master's set through the vendored
      runtime and requires it to fire on the frame the watched byte goes down
      and on no other - which is ADR-0025's argument, executed rather than
      asserted. A negative control with one guard byte wrong must not fire;
      without it the positive proves nothing.

      No core, no ROM, no device - the mapping is a pure function of what a
      core declares - so it is cheap enough for `make check` rather than for
      the conformance suite. It is also the thing that fails if rcheevos is
      updated and the mapping stops agreeing with it.

      **The wiring is tested separately, and had to be.** `test/stateplane.py`
      now runs a game with a set attached and waits for the unlock to arrive
      over the socket, because "the evaluator is correct" and "the evaluator is
      connected to the frame loop" are different claims and this project has
      shipped the first without the second before. The stub core grew a small
      block of predictable system RAM to make that possible.

      Writing it found a fixture bug that had been there all along: **the stub
      core's frame counter carried across games**, because cores stay resident
      (ADR-0006) and nothing reset it on load. Every fixture built on that
      counter - the geometry toggle, the crash frame - therefore meant
      something different on the second game of a run than on the first.

## 14. Failure handling

- [x] **[OPEN]** Core crash behavior (interacts with §3) → a crash while
      loading is `ERROR code=crash` and the launcher keeps the display; a crash
      mid-game is `EXIT reason=crash`. Six modes driven on hardware, and
      `SA_ONSTACK` A/B'd as the difference between reporting a stack overflow
      and reporting nothing. [log](discussion/2026-08-25-crash-reporting.md).
- [x] **[OPEN]** How to fail → [ADR-0009](decisions/0009-launcher-protocol.md)
      settles the shape: `ERROR code=` before RUNNING, `EXIT reason=` after, and
      the split is about display ownership rather than error reporting.
      `core_missing`, `rom_unreadable`, `save_failed`, `state_rejected`,
      `bad_option` and `crash` are all emitted.
- [x] **[OPEN]** **`bios_missing`** - in ADR-0009's table and emitted nowhere
      until 2026-08-25. Now real: a missing System Card fails in **0.01 s** with
      the filename instead of looking like a bad ROM (ADR-0017). **Presence, not
      validity** - 2 KB of random bytes named `syscard3.pce` was accepted and
      the game reported RUNNING.
- [x] **[OPEN]** TortOS's power-off failsafe - answered in §3: the launcher
      stays alive as supervisor and `SIGUSR1` is retained as the escape hatch
      for a core wedged inside `retro_run`.
- [x] **[OPEN]** **The port clock started over every 5 h 7 min of uptime. FIXED
      2026-09-15.** `counter * 1000000 / freq` overflowed, so a deadline set
      before a wrap was live again after it: a 01:38 notice drew over every
      game after the 02:08 wrap. Frame pacing waits on the same clock, and the
      fix held there: Contra ran 9 h 6 min across two wraps, 1,970,019 frames at
      60.10 fps against 60.0998. Why and how: `port/port_clock.h`, `check-port`.

## 15. Build and consumption

- [ ] **[OPEN]** **Three of the five cores on the device are not the pinned
      binaries.** Checked 2026-08-28 against `CORES.md`: `fceumm`,
      `mednafen_pce_fast` and `mgba` all differ; `genesis_plus_gx` and
      `snes9x2010` match.

      **`make check-corefacts` cannot catch this** and never could. It compares
      CORES.md against core-facts.md, both files in this repository, so it
      proves the two agree with each other and says nothing about the binary
      that actually runs. The one instrument that would catch it,
      `tools/corefacts.sh --check`, needs the device and is not part of `make
      check`.

      Everything in core-facts.md therefore describes binaries the device is not
      running, for three of five systems. That includes the sample-rate column,
      which `make check-rates` then enforces across the whole register - so a
      wrong number is propagated with the authority of a passing check.

      This is the third time core identity has produced a wrong conclusion here:
      the 2026-08-25 rate correction, its own correction, and the GBA ratio
      claim on 2026-08-28
      ([log](discussion/2026-08-28-gba-stutter.md)). The pattern is always the
      same and the warning being written down did not prevent the repeat.

      Wants a device-side hash check that runs before any measurement is
      believed, not a note telling people to be careful.
- [ ] **[DEFERRED]** **The Pocket cores are measured nowhere.** A host ships
      `mednafen_ngp` for both Pocket shelves; `CORES.md` pins neither it nor a
      row in `core-facts.md`, so those two systems are the only ones whose core
      is unpinned and whose numbers live in a log line. Consistent rather than
      broken - `check-corefacts.py` fails on "CORES.md pins X but core-facts.md
      never measured it", so pinning without measuring would correctly break
      `make check` - but the matrix stops at nine systems.

      What is known, measured 2026-09-01 from `mednafen_ngp` sha256 a2015668 and
      verified identical on device and host: 160x152 base and max, aspect
      1.0526, 60.2500 fps, 44100 Hz. Deliberately NOT hand-written into
      core-facts.md, which says "generated, do not edit".

      **Deferred 2026-09-01, blocked on ROMs rather than work.**
      `tools/corefacts.sh` re-measures every row and six of its ten fixtures are
      absent from the test set. The exposure this would catch - a core changing
      under a measurement - is already covered for this core by a host pinning
      it by sha256, verified byte-identical on the card. What is missing is
      completeness, and nothing depends on the row.

      **Trigger: swapping either Pocket core.** The RACE question in §9 is the
      likely cause. Nothing would report that geometry, fps or rate had moved,
      so measure before the swap lands.
- [x] **[OPEN]** C standard and toolchain →
      **[ADR-0012](decisions/0012-independent-toolchain.md)** *(Accepted)*.
      `gnu11`, and Diatom builds its own pinned cross-toolchain rather than
      borrowing another firmware's. Reusing TortOS's would have made Diatom
      depend on a repository it is meant to be independent of.
- [x] **[OPEN]** Cross-device build matrix → **two targets, both green.**
      `make` for desktop and `tools/brick-make.sh` for the Brick, the latter in
      a pinned container ([ADR-0012](decisions/0012-independent-toolchain.md))
      with a staleness guard, because the container silently skipped rebuilds
      twice. A third target arrives with the Miniloong port, which is [NOT
      PLANNED] (§4).
